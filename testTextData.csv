"I love samsung since da launch of it with android feature.since dan, i never look for other brands as my more trust is on Samsung brands due to its technical competency dan other brands. Samsung m20 is among those mobiles. Love to handle this phone since two months. Only issue, which m facing is to take rapid screen shots from touch instead of buttons. Orelse , its mindblowing cellphone.All in my friend circle appreciate this phone."
"Overall product is good, but if u have network issues in ur area then don't go for this. Reception is disgusting."

"Overall a good phone...

Though the processor could have been better, but considering rest of the features offered I would say it's fine...

It's definitely not a gaming centric phone, you can play games, but it might stutter at max settings like in PUBG.

You get good cameras (macro is mostly useless to me),
a great battery (lasts me a whole day on medium-heavy use) and
a good display...
I would say it is mostly focused towards those who watch a lot of videos..."

"I received samsung's m30 gradation blue on 25th Apr,  same as it is mentioned in description.  It's color and looks very attracted me.  Specially cameras &  fingerprint reader working excellent.  sAmoled FHD + display is very nice.  5000mAh battery along with 3 x fast charger is great."
"Finger print sensor is too gud, screen quality is awesome, battery backup is best, face lock is very fast than other phones & hardly took 1 second to unlock. The only drawback is camera quality, its too bad even worst than Chinese phones."

"Sushi is not just a meal, it's an experience...Everything from the way fish looks to the crisp green of the seaweed is art.  The smell of the sake and the sound of crisp sizzle on the grill create an environment conducive to stretching the palette.  Yasu's does this like no other sushi place...The fish is pristine, the rice like air, and the flavors intense and varied.  My wife and I live a stone's throw from this place you would never see it if you didn't know it was there.  It's like a little secret that is starting to get out...All I can say is that it is hands down the BEST sushi in Phoenix, period.  Get the fried oyster rolls, get the grilled mackerel or trout...just try it!"
Ok
Mobile camera so bad Quality front camera 13 mp and back camera 48 mp but picture are not 48mp photo.  Clearty not good.

"I have received the package with all the security and pin number and parcel code as though it was delivered by the IB. Then realized that people have been sent soap and marbles in such packaging in the past that Amazon had to secure it from the middlemen who sneak it through.
The 7T is a powerhouse and yet it saves a lot of power to push you through the day. All in all, the phone is excellent with a lot of tinkering options available for you to play with this handful of tech marble(not marvel). But the irony is not lost on the fact that I have clicked the attached pics with one of the better camera phones (Honor 8 pro) for the review. Will update with the pics clicked by 7T soon. Thanks to Amazon for the timely delivery and Thanks OP for maintaining the quality and challenging the status quo.
Never Settle OP."

"Roka Akor Scottsdale is an extension of the celebrated Roka in London.
I attended the opening night and a follow up for lunch the following day. Overall, I was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi, and robata grilled tidbits. The dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik.
I drank many fresh sochu  infused cocktails, and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled Kikisake-shi, Sayaka Watanabe. This Japanese sake sommelier is London-based and the zuma-roka group sake trainer. They do have a fantastic sake selection. Easily the best in Scottsdale. She loved my sake brand I created with Midorikawa called Green River, and my low alcohol brand sake, Koide, as well.
They also have a great Italian Sommelier named Alessandro Marchesan, who is also based out of London. Too bad they are only loaner personnel from HQ in London.
The room is clean and beautiful with post modern Asian inspired lines. The staff is eager and young, but quite unskilled in refined service.  I am sure that will be a long cycle for the Roka management to fix. I have a dear friend who dined there on her birthday. She told me the service was ""shockingly bad."" She then reiterated that is was,  ""so bad that it was entertainingly bad!"" The food great and hopefully the service will match soon. Kanpai, Roka..kudos on your sake program."

"I am a huge ""foodie"", from a long line of ""foodies"". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) :
O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked."

"The food is moderately priced and good, but the drinks are outrageously Scottsdale expensive.  I'll admit that they key lime martini was very delicious.  The Hell's Fire chips and Asian shrimp were perfect, and I would definitely recommend the food.  The lighting, more like a glow than a light, was quite awesome.  Service was pretty slow but professional.  The dj was great!  No one was wearing jeans, but there was a mixed crowd of some people in their 40's and many in their late 20's or early 30's."
Amazing Battery performance... After full day use with WhatsApp Facebook and calling 64% battery was left in the evening... No doubt camera is awesome... Processor speed is pretty good and 6gb Ram with 128 GB internal is more than enough for advance users...

"If you are looking to get a gaming phone with best performance you are at right place, you can play PUBG Battle Royale at HDR ,Extreme Graphics. Sound quality it also very good, if you won't miss headphone if you are using speakers while gaming because of the dual sound spearkers.
I would give 3/5 to both cameras not good but not bad as well.
Fingerprint reader is pretty slow, sometimes it does not detects the print, I have to rely on face lock.
I would say battery life of the phone is pretty choppy, it drains faster when you are playing games. I have not seen any heating problem in  my phone after this one month experience.
After buying the phone after a couple of days one of my friend also bought the same varient"
Performance quality is not much as expected....also delay in opening apps..and network supporting is also bad... finger print scanner is slow and battery life is normal as my previous one..the phone gets stuck even while playing small games...its bad decision to buy this...also can't even return this thing

"Janno Reiljan , a member of the Eesti Energia supervisory board , said the owners of Narva Power Grid had informed Eesti Energia about their wish to sell ."

"Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.
Cons:
1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.

2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.

3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.

Pros:
1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.

2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.

3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom."

"An interesting concept that didn't end up being what I hoped for.  

I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.

The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.

Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.

Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.

Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.

Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat

Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily

The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.

The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal."

"i know they're doing their jobs and i can understand that. but we couldn't shake our saleslady. we finally had to say that if she didn't leave us alone, we were going to leave. we absolutely couldn't discuss anything because she was CONSTANTLY THERE! we even said we'll come find you if we need any help. literally any piece we glanced at, touched, or came near, she was on top of us ""oh isn't this a great piece. we can set up financing and lock in the sales price, and if you buy 5k worth today with cash, we'll throw in...etc"". every single item. 
they have nice stuff, no question about that. but i know this game. and it's not fun. it makes shopping miserable. and besides, it's too expensive for us. we got 3 of the same, exact pieces (same model, same sku) at pruitts for less than half we would have paid at Ashleys."
The best quality and camera battery long time
Nice mobile. I love it
Nice and good
"I love me some coffee. The french roast brew is perfect for surviving a long day of work. If you want something sweet, order the iced raspberry mocha. Just the right amount of sweetness without tasting like you're drinking syrup. The muffins are moist and delicious. The spinach salad here is surprisingly amazing (yes, they make spinach salad at this coffee place). The best part about this place? It is not full of hipsters and college students who hog all the decent seating and never leave. I can't wait to go back to try all of the other drinks offered."
Better product
I am dissapointed with camera but phone us very unique abd stylish
It`s been doing it for two days. We have a comcast technician scheduled for tomorrow morning.
Worst mobile  not purchase this item my mobile software update but not touch work  40 day samsang service center display change not respect and redy am use nokia 1209 mobile
Phone is worst.. camera is not good.. not worth buying.. Samsung again disappointed like always
"The phone has major touch glitches. After trying at least 3-4 times, got this phone recently. All the excitement of receiving a new phone vanished when the touch started acting up. The phone shudders and starts operating on its own without even touching it. The camera features are quite good but the phone should be made stable first. Disappointed. Don't buy in flash sale. Their testing process is still going on."
This is amazing mob. Nice one. You can buy it.
"Fake bc camera doesn't work properly
And its damage piece
Dont trust on Amazon prime"
Some times phone is hanging....software  speed dull....not bad.....worth of money..

Nice product
Nice phone within the budget
Average phone
Mobile is very problem and battery problem
"Firstly, its a great phone... i mean the best in this price range. I had many options like redmi, vivo, oppo, but after a lot of research i decided to give Samsung a chance, and ooh boy I'm happy.

The display of the phone only makes it worth the price, and one ui is also very very good, I have used color os, and miui before and i can say the one ui wouldn't disappoint you.

The battery life is above satisfactory, and I'm a really heavy user, so you can do the math.

The fingerprint reader is sadly average and not as fast as you would expect it to be.

And lastly the camera software of this phone sucks...front camera is decent but the rest is really really bad, i can say my 2years old oppo had better camera than this one, but that was a bit fixed with gcam mod which you can download if camera really matters to you that much.

Finally the performance will not disappoint you, it'll handle multitasking effortlessly.
And can't say anything about gaming cause I'm not much of a gamer."
Satisfaction
Nice
the sing store won`t work.
"Android One lack basic features which are there in MIUI. You can not turn off notifications tone which is quite irritating.
Only way is go in individual apps settings and turn off notifications.
Camara quality is poor.
Screen quality is good.

Don't purchase this phone. Rather go for normal MI phones. MI A (Android one) series has so many bugs in different applications that you will scratch your head. I want to through my phone but just keeping my cool as I have paid rs12000 for it."
Best mobile at the best price..... awesome camera and nice battery pack up.....must use phone...and budget Mobile.....
"Camera,fingerprint, and battery is awesome in small budget. Samsung Galaxy M30 phone is so beautiful  and no other company will give this future in this budget but Samsung is big brand."
Best quality of camera
Only I problem is inside Camera quality is not good . So I give only 2 star .  according to 48 mp camera . Quality like 8 megapixel
"Elisa Corporation will disclose its financial statements for 2006 on Thursday , 8 February 2007 ."
"Good phone in this budget and better than mi redminote 8 pro.
First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good"

Its not a standard restaurant as it is in the middle of a grocery store...but thats just what it is get over it!  The food however is fantastic!  I ordered the samosa chaat...A samosa covered in chick peas and other sauces and chatney.  A delicious Punjabi snack!  The portion was very generous and the price cheap.  I also recently ordered a dozen samosas to bring home and serve at a dinner party.  Very convenient and good service.  I will be a regular from now on!

Invoice copy print is bad pls arrange clear print invoce copy these problem regularly

It was so mesmerize to use this high end features in this minimal amount of price. Worth to bought this M31☺☺
"Battery & Speed - Very Good
Camera - Very Bad
Gaming for long time - Heating near camera"
Screen size ratio 3:2 is good. But the fone's screen size is not 3:2.
I purchased this mobile on first flash sale on 05-02-2019. After using some days the mobile was not charging. I took my mobile to my nearest service center they repaired and again not charging less than 10 days of repair. I again go to service center they repaired again and same way from next two days onwards it is not charging. I bored to repair again and again. Finally I did not know the actual reason for not charging my mobile.
also finally home with no friends or anyone.. kinda nice to sit in a quiet room.. do wish the gf was here tho...
Phone is a complete package..it has awesome cameras..front 32 mp camera is awesome..battery is very good..design looks premium..and excellent..five star phone
"There is big problem related to charging in this phone and many c type (fast charging) phones. I visited 4 times in service center,I found approximate all customers around me have same type charging problems. Except this phone  works well."
"M31 have heating issues. It heats up if you do continues call for 10 mins, gaming, using hotspot for longer during, streaming... only good thing is battery back up and screen sturdiness"
Best mobile in this range
Awesome battery life
Absolutely great value for money.
Worst mobile which i have ever seen
Like the product very and its my 3time inm buying the phone
Nice.
One of the best phone I had since last 20 years I had used. Very long battery life and very good camera and pictures quality ever seen
Battery life is good...size of the screen is big...but camera quality is little bit bad compare than other mi products..
Battery life is amazing while the camera quality sucks
Awesome product

"Decent bar food with all the servers dressed in Alice Cooper attire.  
I am being open-minded and starting this thing off with 5 stars.  

Minus one star for being a bit overpriced on the appetizer end.  I ordered onion rings at $8 per order.  Seriously, are 15 onion rings worth $8? 

Minus one star for not having any parking.  You have to park a couple of blocks away in the ghetto area to find a spot.  You will have 2-3 beggars asking you for change to and from your car.  There was a dude who wanted to wash my windows for money.  

Minus half a star for putting the gratuity on the bill and charging for it.  I hate that crap.  

Plus half a star for the waitresses who are dressed heavy metal-like wearing mid-riffs with the tramp stamp.  I always wanted to date chicks like that, but was ummm...to busy with umm....other chicks chasing me down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I just umm...you know, didnt have time for them at that point in my life.  

I better stop my review now."
"1st I'am Samsung brand lover.
Overall phone is it's best.but when i inserting sim cards the tray is not coming out l tried 20to 30 times after tray comes out one of the cheapest sim tray I never seen in Samsung brand pls check the overallphone before delivering to customers.
Performance - overall to my uses it's amazing.
Camera quality - just wow selfie cam.
Battery - this is the reason i never seen such a battery backup in Samsung using all over day.
Display - mindblowing&stunning when watching movies YouTube on this screen never you got this experience in this price range."
" Oh dear, it will be late there.... good ol Michigan!  Well I look forward to chatting with you when our wakeful hours overlap."
No 4G compatibility. Pls dont buy this phone as it has zero functions. Features are as good as 4 year old samsung phones.

"Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.

As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem."
"Loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee.  The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the ""WBC"" and they've discontinued making their bread salad. (Very disappointing)  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess.

I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.  I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.   

This type of service is what makes a customer for life."
I thought it was a simple one  I found it hilarious.
I like this product. Camera quality is excellent as it has an ultra wide angle camera. Battery life is good.  it has a very cool design and it's water drop notch makes it more cool. Overall i would say it is a very good and worthy package.
Amazon is not helping to replace the product as I am facing battery drainage issue
Camera is not as good as it should be.

"We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food, service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday. It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasn't happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views... Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish... The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor... 

The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good. The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience.. 

I can't wait to go back when it's a little cooler to sit outside...Don't miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!"

I know.  There`s no reason for any of that.
Beast of a phone at this price. Only drawback being the bloaty UI. I am not a fan of MIUI especially the annoying ads popping up now and then. Wish they have provided stock android.
The phone is best in this price becos its camera is just amazing. If you are a photogenic person and your budget is 10000 then just go for this phone its overall performance is very good 👍👌
"LOVE LOVE LOVE the ambience outside! Love the fact the restaurant is in a old style bungalow and the patio is lit with string lights.

I went there for the first time last night 15min before close and I dont know if they usually have music or not..but if they don't, they need it. 

Food was great but nothing to die for."

"A HUGE, Monstrous (5000 mAh) and lot of battery for little money. The biggest USP of the Galaxy M20 is its battery prowess and the handset can stay away from the charger for long. The Galaxy M20 from Samsung brings premium features to the middle class at an entry-level price.

The phone is quite unlike any of the earlier affordable phones from Samsung phones. At the back M20 features a polycarbonate back with a glossy finish, lending it a classy appeal.

Galaxy M20 features a TFT panel, the colour reproduction is pretty good, and so are the brightness levels. Harsh sunlight doesn't pose any issues as far as screen legibility is concerned. The screen is protected by a layer of Asahi's Dragontrail glass to keep scratches and minor nicks at bay.

The Galaxy M20 is the brand's first handset to come powered by Samsung's Exynos 7904 chipset, Infinity V Display with a panel measuring 6.3-inches and a full HD+ resolution making the visuals very crisp.

The Marvel phone ships with a pair of shooters on the rear. There is a dual-camera setup accompanied by an LED flash and an oblong-shaped fingerprint reader.
The combination is made up of a 13-megapixel f/1.9 shooter, a wide-angle sensor with a resolution of 5MP and an aperture of f/2.2. For selfies, the smartphone comes with an 8MP snapper. The colours are pleasing to the eyes and details are spot on as well, be it in the landscapes or close-up shots. It is also a dual-SIM smartphone.
It is packed with a good speaker which is paramount to enjoying multimedia on the go with a large screen and does a good job of offering loud and clear output. Overall it's a smooth experience. Samsung have a winner on its hands."

Camera clarity is superb. In today's life main headeck is battery charging and this phone takes less than fifteen minutes to full charge. Fingerprint reader gives us security that without your permission nobody can check your phone. In this much prize it is very good phone Thats why I gave 5 stars to this phone.

"We held a meeting planner's luncheon inviting local clients to our hotel that host regular meetings.  Our theme was ""getting to the core of your meeting"" and the entire event had an apple theme.  Yuri's Popcorn created a special flavor green apple for our event and it was a nice compliment to our other offerings.  Our attendees absolutely loved it and were excited about all the creative and delicious offerings, including centerpieces with an arrangement of candies and popcorn beautifully arranged into a bouquet of yumminess.

Several months ago, we hosted a lemonade stand for a client serving glasses of flavored lemonade.  Yuri's created another fun flavor....lemon....that was well received by all.

They offer the perfect gifts for clients and everything is very affordable when you're on a tight budget.

Thank you!"

They are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff."

"The Camelback Barber Shop has very good service with a hot towel, shoulder massage, straight razor trim and, at least if you ask for Albert, get your hair cut with scissors. All for under $20 (plus tip). My Dad says it is one of the best barber shops that he has used--and they are very nice to us service dogs too!  It can be a little hard to find, but it is in the breezeway between the two buildings, walk down through there and you will find it about halfway down."
Samsung Galaxy M30 is a good phone but the fingerprint sensor provided is not sensitive which is a little discouragement..  Over all the phone is good and worth the money..Comparing other phone this phone has a good look..Go for it guys
"Its a direct NO if you're purchasing for gaming. Don't even get that thought. The processor is very slow and takes ages to load. Graphics doesn't work properly in high graphics mode. No smoothness at all.

This one is great. Finger print reader is tough to locate for older people. I brought it for my father. He now uses password as he has to flip to locate the reader. Good battery back up. Last days. And nice screen resolution

"Vegan Mexican with a urban funk to it. Should it work?  I dont know. Did it work?  Not really.

We walked in, it was empty quiet and after 20 seconds a surprised guy walked in and greets us. We take out seat on the purple booths and browse the menu while we sip watermelon water. Things got a bit stranger from there.

The menu had many interesting options, but each one we tried to order we found out that the didn't have chips, mushrooms or chorizo, key ingredients in many of the things on the menu. We had to just ask what can we order.

We ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark. 

Our tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.5 tacos I assume the 1/2 a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side.

The tacos them selves were good, nice flavors crunch etc. for $8-$9 they should be good.  However the other problem sunk in as we were leaving, we were still hungry and after $21 and 45 min we were less than happy.

The next day they had posted a photo to Facebook, not about their food, or a special but look how how our waiter/cook is.   

So I guess if you want to look at toned male waiter this is your spot. Otherwise there are many kinks that need to be worked out."

Great usage..battery and camera were better than I expected...only thing when used for more than an hour phone gets a little warm but even then i did not find any glitches....

"Have used Mi A1 for 2+ years and really loved the camera quality and Stock Android experience. It impressed me so much that I went ahead and bought this phone and I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised. The quality of camera especially low light photos are good for amateur photographers. Performance is good and it can run RAM heavy apps without much of an issue. Battery life is pretty good with backup of 1 full day with extensive use, with data/WiFi always on and hotspot on for couple of hours a day."
Fabulous smartphone
"Pros:
Very handy, with a crisp display.
Battery
Camera

Cons:
Sound not the best, just average  or below
Fingerprint sensor not the fastest.
Face recognition not bad but takes time."

In this price range other companies like realme has better quality phones and operating experience is also not bery smooth but you can't said that its best deal. Performance battery and camera is good and one thing i have to mention here that is charging duration is really less 18 watt power charger is really good.

"After my last review, somewhat scathing regarding the burgers, I got an invite from the management to come down, meet the chef and give him another try.  I thought to myself, ""how nice"", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.

So, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a ""different"" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now."
"Thought it will be good mobile for mom, but its more inferior than samsung galaxy J7 which my mom used previously. Battery life is worst,for 1st 12 days it worked properly since its given with 5000mah battery with 28hrs+ for videos, it used to work for 1 and half day, but now  almost after 20 days of purchasing,  watching youtube videos for 1 hr, battery goes down from 100% to 30%. And i hv bad experience with service center, if given mobile for this battery reason,  then they will just reset ur mobile and give it back, so i guess no use of going to service center also, so my money is wasted on this cheap samsung M20. Never again in my life i will by samsung mobiles."

Ilove one plus series. This phone is a beast i will recommend everyone to buy this. The packing was perfect and i dnt have any complaint. The battery life is good and the phone looks premium in ur hands. Must go for this.

Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel. The battery was a beast and gives pretty good enough time to use the phone for long time. Camera was nice and overall phone performance was awesome. Really good product  from SAMSUNG."

Great fruit and vegetables. Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value. Check out the meat and deli. Cage free chicken and grass fed beef. Salmon and Tuna are fresh. They do have some good values here. The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount.
"Pros : 1. Premium design - all glass and metal build which looks awesome and feels very premium in hand.
2. Oxyzen OS - it was the prime reason why I switched from poco F1 to OnePlus and it certainly didn't disappoint. Absolute joy to use this device due to clean and almost stock andriod experience with nice customisations.
3. Speakers - The dual stereo speakers are of top notch quality and you will never use in maximum output and still it's more louder than other flagsip devices.
4. 90 hertz refresh rate - Another deal maker is this utterly smooth 90 hertz refresh rate which is the best thing in OnePlus devises. Use it to believe it.
5. Camera - Better than expected rear facing camera which produces crisp and detailed pictures in both daylight and lowlight conditions. Selfie camera are also good.
6. Screen and sensors - The fluid amoled screen is just a treat for the eyes. All the sensors are working blazingly fast like fingerprint sensor and face unlock but missing the ir blaster.

Cons: 1. Battery life - Battery life is not that great will last for a day in moderate use. But the warp charger will fill the juices blazingly fast so not a deal breaker.
2. Camera bump- although the design is solid and cool but there is a slight tilt when u keep the phone in flat surfaces due to the camera bump.

Overall an amazing and allrounder phone from OnePlus. Just close your eyes and buy if u want a premium device in mid range price.

P.S. Purchased thru Amazon prime and got SBI disc of 2000."

"My previous review was not published by Amazon for god knows what reason.
Anyways previously i had one cell to complain about and now i have two of it.

Long story short:-
There is either something fishy about Redmi Note 8 or the seller Darshita Electronics.
I received my phone a few days back (Neptune Blue 6+64). It had left over glue on the right top side of the screen rim. The same kind of glue was present on the volume rocker (pics attached).
Surprisingly seal on one side of the box was open while the other seal was intact. I had the unboxing video and raised a request for replacement. Technical inspection was done by Amazon Partner and the phone was okayed for replacement.

Today i received my replacement phone and the seals were intact but it has the same glue issue. (Pics attached)

I have bought several phones and many from Amazon as well too but this time its been a bad bad experience. There can be a QC error from Redmi once a while but certainly not in every phone. I seriously doubt the seller Darshita Electronics."

Great quality product from oppo... Great price too.... Please don't compare mi phones with oppo regarding pricing... Oppo quality of the product is amazing... Look and feel also great... I have jus used the phone for 1 day before this review.. amazing phone... Fast charging is superb.. little bit over weight than my last phone oppo f3.. but manageable.. and as it is 8 GB ram... Battery consumption is bit higher than 6 GB ram phones.. but that's too manageable... But quality wise... Oppo Reno 2 f is amazing.. superb features too
Its heating up while video calls also it has started hanging already. It gets difficult.to pick up video calls and switch rare cam to front or vice versa. Applications get frozen.Every month there are new issues. With every software update the previous issues get fixed but a new one starts. M seriously annoyed with this phone

"The phone is really good ..
Pros-
1- Full HD Display,It  is bright, clear ..I love always on display.
2- I have used MIUI but OneUi is far better than that .Speacialy the Ram Management of Samsung is awesome ..Also OneUi have less Bloatware even u can uninstall them.Remember OS is the very important part of your phone You can't run hardware Directly that why we use OS ..
3- Bettery Life is great.

Cons-
1- There is network issue ..1 or 2 stick less by compare to other phones.
2- Average camera
3-Plastic Back

Conclusion -
I bought it at 8100 Rs ..this is one of the best option in this price range ..Even this phone is worthy at 10k price range .."

2)Camera clearity is very poor. I were using the 7 and it have better camera than 7t. when we shoot video in slow-motion in night ata time some lines continues passing through on video.so overall all camera results poor compare to other mobile phone.

I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices."
"My husband and I drove from LA to Scottsdale and almost to Scottsdale, one of our tires was going flat.  We went to Discount Tire on Shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel (the tires are new).  They helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning.  They were nice, helpful, honest and affordable.  Absolutely great service!  I highly recommend them."
Very nice 👌

One of the worst product from Samsung. Very slow operating product.performance of connecting internet is not at level.i suggest people don't go for this product ..it doesn't met the expectations as it has 4gb ram in built.perfomrs not even at level.touch is very bad ..only Camara you can expect some good clicks at daylight..become very slow now and irritates alot as some time net connectivity goes off itself ..I dont know which technology has been used by brand samsung..totally utter waste of investment on this cell phone.
Don't buy this phone. Don't waste your money. It is the worst phone from Xiaomi. Worst fingerprint scanner which never works when needed. Display quality bad. Only positive thing is good camera. No call recording. No screen recording. No internet speed. Speed not as expected.
Camera is not good as compare to other mobiles of this range
"Dear samsung team,
This phone is quite good but camera quality as compared to mi A2 is not up to the mark."
"Battery lasts whole day, fingerprint sensor was really fast. Processor was average, it lags too much after several weeks. No issues occured in first month, but after that it lags too much while using (>50mb) applications such as instagram, facebook. Also, pubg lags in low settings also.
Build quality was cheaper, made with plastic back."
Nice product
now or never' makes me cry everytime  lol.
Slowest phone ever. It lags every now and then. Not at all satisfied
to be honest one the best phone ever made with a high quality of specs..this phone is  exceptional in every way ..but the most dissapointing thing  was the battery ...it's avg ... for a hectic user it's avg man ..we need to believe it... even 90hz refresh rate eats a lots of battery ...i am using this phone in  60hz refresh rate for a better battery performance...except this battery issue  every thing is just amazing to use phone like this...
"RT @becca0mae: I don't know who won the debate, but @Writeintrump definitely won the award for ""best #GOPDebate live tweeting"""
"Disappointed. super fast fingerprint sensor, battery Is really monstrous..  34perc. Still left after full day usage on YouTube and movies. Camera is very bad.. rear camera pictures not up to the mark.. it seems it is only a 8 or 10 mp camera.got burred on zoom.."

Battery backup is so bad if I charge to 100% and use it for few hours it comes back to 50% soon not as what I expected as per 6000 mah I would be returning it back soon

"I've practiced yoga for years at At One Yoga and initially wasn't happy about their merger with LifePower. But now, after several months of going to LifePower, I think it's pretty nice. 

The facility is big and clean and very well kept. If you want to use the entire facility (the weights and machines) you have to sign up for a monthly contract. However, if you just want to take the yoga classes, you can buy them packages of ten classes. The ten classes can be used over any length of time. I like that because if I'm out of town or busy, my class package doesn't expire. I do wish they offered more class packages, like in groups of 25 or 50 classes, the the way At One Yoga used to do. Because typically the more classes you buy, the bigger the discount. 

The great majority of the yoga instructors from At One Yoga have come over to teach at LifePower. I've taken yoga classes in several places throughout the US and I think these yoga teachers are among the best in the country."
Nice product

idk if i could.  it would cost me soo much there.

No case cover in the box
plastic build"
it's a great product by one plus camera quality good charging is supeb very quick overall superb but the camera bump is not gud for scratches and all it should be inside not outside...
Network signal very poor
Good phone under 10k
All the features are awesome
"Treated my sister-in-law to a message here on Super Bowl Sunday.  They have great hours & were very accommodating even though we only made our appts about 24 hours in advance.  When we booked, the receptionist (who was really helpful and nice) mentioned the groupon promotion ($40 for $100 worth of services) as well as SpaFinder gift cards.  We thought we could combine them, and we arrived at our appt to find that they weren't supposed to combine discounts.  But the receptionist made an exception and we were really appreciative!

The massage was nice, could have used a little more pressure.  Cute atmosphere and friendly/helpful staff.  I would come back, especially with SpaFinder/discounts."
Good Product.

"Probably the worst product in this range. Starting to lag in just 3 months with half of it's dedicated memory empty. Doesn't function well at times, after the new UI update it went to bad to worst. Just wanted to get rid of this. Do not buy this, far better product is available with various other not-so-famous brands in the same price range. Utterly disappointed by this."

"Boss just texted me, I HAVE THE DAY OFF! YES< YES AND YES AGAIN!"
"ok....first let me say that I grew up in PHX. And we used to go for special occasions to ""Bobby MaGees"" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).

But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).

We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...

I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). 

The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. 

Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.

But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.

I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.

Side note: Hilarious crowd on a Saturday night. Lots of ""west side"" clubbers...or maybe too old to be clubbers but want to go clubbing (there is a lounge attached)."
Good Morning and thanks for the Retweet

Very good

"While I give the management props for honoring our gift certificate, even though our total rang up below the minimum price, the food was teh ick. 

I got the fish tacos. I understand the urge to make them unique, and different from the thousands of varieties of fish tacos available in the Valley. But this attempt was a huge miss. 

The tilapia tasted pretty muddy, even for tilapia. It was served with a really sweet, sticky, almost BBQ-style sauce. I was alternately pleased that it was so cloying that it almost covered the icky river flavor of the tilapia, and perplexed at this odd pairing. The avocados also had a funny, chemical flavor to them. Double-yuck."
Super nice
"front camera.....it is wrost then you may imagine....😬
It gets hanged in every minute...dont buy any samsung mobile never ever"
Mobile keeps hanging .. very slow when moving between apps
Screen is not good... don't waste money to buy it

It's a good product.

1. 48 mp camera for an amazing picture quality
2. 4 Gb of ram & 64 Gb internal memory for amazing Gaming experience
3. 4030 battery is enough for 2 days moreover the fast charging also works wonders.
4. It has IR Blaster so you can control your tv, ac, projector from this mobile.
I am happy with this product
Really worth it 👍"
Awesome phone!
"Except camera everything in the phone was excellent. The camera is okay you can get good quality pics at day time.

Night time the camera won't delivered good photos. When compare to high end models the camera was not delivered that quality but wide angle shots was awesome"
Very good product in this price

Don't buy it useless product its heating very fast and at very high level and battery is also draining quickly for my request amazon made my product changed.
"worst phone ever in my life ,even 3 gb ram of other phone is better than m20,processor  is very slow,i cant explain  how bad this phone is.."
"Never disappointed with this place!

Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me. 

I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good. 

Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.

My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner? Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends. I am sure they will all love Joe's and I can't wait for them to try it!"

I have brought it for 18500rs (6GB 128gb). It is a good mobile with this price. Just camera quality is not so good. There are lot of options availble in low budget(like redmi note 7 pro ) if you want to best camera. Remaining parts like sound quality and network capturing quality and internet speed are all awesome.
Display average but good mobile
Beautiful phn....so classy!!!!

"Strange just strange. I park here when I travel out of town. I used the valet parking once last year and don't remember any issues. Today was my second time... I dropped my car off last week. The airport shuttle was waiting for me at baggage claim when my flight landed at midnight. I went to pick up my car after a long flight as was told ""it's at the front"", the valet guy pointed and disappeared. I was left standing alone wondering if there was another side of the hotel where my car was?? I walked into the lobby and the receptionist was quick to tell me there is a balance on my account. Huh?? Number one I don't have an account at the hotel and number two I didn't stay here overnight. Again I'm standing there thinking what is going on, is he getting my mixed up with someone else? Finally he explained the parking wasn't prepaid and I needed to pay in a order to get my car. He gave me a bit of an attitude as if I was refusing to pay. Dude, it's 12:30am, I just got off a long flight & didn't realize my fiancé didn't prepay online when he set the whole thing up for me online. All this confusion could have been spared if the valet guy would have just said ""you pay at the desk"" instead of ""its at the front"" which is unclear and indirect. I think next time I go out of town ill try a different parking garage."
GOOD
"I loved this phone, touch screen is so smooth, camera quality is too good n battery backup  is very good. My phone is connected to wifi while n I am using internet as much as required but I need once in a day to charge my mobile full, battery is powerful that is best thing in this phone. Perfect phone in this price range and Samsung is always best."

Battery power sucks
Camara quality is superb

"Overall an excellent phone by Samsung. What surprised me was the battery backup. Even though I play Call of Duty for about 2-3 hours a day, I can go more than 24 hours without charging. The camera is excellent too. The Samsung Galaxy M31 is the best phone I have used till date. Infact it is way better than phones segments above it. Close youe eyes and buy this one. Good job Samsung!"

"Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. Healthy, hearty and great service. It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;)

Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)"
Though they have mentioned 6 gb RAM...but.it didn't work as 2 gb RAM phone..lots of hang problem ....even you can't open 2 pages simultaneously...my old phone mi 4 with 4gb RAM phone was far much better than this bakwas phone...even my mi 4 is still working perfectly never hang...just it doesn't have triple slot that's why i switch over this ghatiya quality phone...low camera quality...low finger print scanner...face recognition is totally dumb....even i bought it with 128 gb internal memory still it hangs a lot...i wasted my money...prefer to buy redmi phone or oneplusT phone..

06. Sound Quality (Scratchy sounds and terribly low quality when you plug into YouTube and during cellular calls)

The stock was hit by the profit warning of Finnish rival Rautaruukki Oyj ( OMX : RTRKS ) .
"I having using this since last about two weeks, found it to extremely good, far superior to my earlier Samsung M30. Battery lasts for almost 2 to 2.5 days, for me atleast as I do not play games. Both cameras are pretty decent, finger print scanner works fine. Only down side is that it is slightly on the heavier side, which is fine for me. All in all an excellent product from Redmi. Worth buying."
" Had lunch at Bittercreek, they were out of Hopnoxious  Had Sweetgrass IPA tho, so all is still right in the world."

Another night of not sleeping
Good mobile . Good camera. Good sound.. good battery life..
"Best phone under 15K segment...
Display 10/10
Battery 10/10
Looks and performance way better then chinese Realme and xiaomi..believe me no one can make better display in this price range.."
"The device is excellent
It gives u a premium feeling
The display is jus awesome
The amoled display is so nice
Very useful for the multimedia consumers
The front camera is not so good
The back camera is excellent
The  battery life is awesome
Not soo good with gaming performance though
Pubg like games will struck
U have to play it in mid to low settings
The charging time is more coz of the 15w charger, it's kinda old model

Conclusion:
If u are a multimedia consumer who watch movies and videos alike, and who are a battery fan, and would love to use the back camera much
Then this is THE BEST MOBILE FOR YOU

If u want more performance oriented phones for gaming purposes, and a selfie addict and don't care abt bat display, then this phone will disappoint you... I would suggest u to go for other phones

But other than that, overall the phone is great..."
"Very bad performance of this device ,
Hang strat in 10 days"
Battery life is only one day and camera quality just meets 48 mp of Oppo f11

Type c audio adapter/ Headphone was not in the box as mentioned on the box.
"Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.

The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  

For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.  

Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night."
The margarita pizza is awesome. They use a delicious red sauce that I would be happy to eat on noodles- much different than a lot of pizza places that just use a tasteless red goo. Good crust too! The organic root beer is pretty gross though.

The battery life of the mobile is too good and features like Dolby atmos Sound and face recognition and triple camera are worth encouragable but the model is quite routine and we have to take extra care to handle the mobile.
"Phone is not as expected ... display is not good ... phone is slow ... when I bought it I was expecting lot as MI has shown in add ... camera is worst.

Good thing is stock android the only thing I like it.

Amazon technician visited my place and found the camera problem. I requested Amazon to return this phone and would like to go with different phone. My expectation was different with this phone.

Amazon didn’t return it they just replaced it and I am not satisfied with this purchase. Amazon did to me when I am a almost 7 years old customer of Amazon. I told that I don’t want money, keep it in my account and I would like to go with different phone as this phone is not as I was expected.

Amazon customer executive didn’t find a way to help , instead of that they just said this is what we can do only replace with same phone. Still camera is not doing ... fingerprint is slow .. phone is slow ... but I am not going to complain again becoz they may check found the issue they will just replace which doesn’t make any sense.

Request to buyers ... please read the policy carefully when you bye anything from Amazon. I am customer of Amazon from US and was having the same mind set that if you didn’t like thing you can return and get the right one which you like, but this is not same in India. So be careful we may need to check physically in store before buying it online ... as you may stick with these policies and stuck with the things which you don’t like."
"Kudos for the lighting fast delivery
Phone is great as it maintains the legacy of oneplus
Camera is good and even it can beat dslr images if you have the skills the only thing i missed is the headphone jack"
Not good display
"Super quality as I am using from last 10 days, battery backup is also good and the charging time is also too much less than other phones.  As my experience  overall phone is very good. Thanks to AMAZON"
"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!

I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.

The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.

I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.

Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.

About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  

Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!

On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.

For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long."

Thank you Samsung for the really good mobile with affordable price"
Nice MOBILE
"Well its a down to earth honest review of OnePlus 7T after using it for one month. First thing this phone is made for single guys like me as it says ""Never Settle"" well just kidding. I replaced my old Samsung Galaxy A30 and decided to go for OnePlus for the first time. Well it paid off superbly. It is a real flagship killer at this price range and it makes Iphone and Samsung look bad to some extent. Coming to the performance its blazing fast with that sweet Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ processor and 8GB of ram. The fingerprint scanner is also super fast and well designed too. The fluid AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate was something that the OnePlus first introduced it in the market and rest all other smartphone company just followed along the standards set by OnePlus on its flagship device. With 1 month of usage I found the following important pros:-

1) Blazing fast - do not worry about lags anymore.
2) Network connectivity with this phone is also superb as OnePlus claims it is due to the new processor that results in 15% faster network acquisition. Downloads are blazing fast on Airtel 4G
3)Oxygen OS v10 based on stock android 10 - the OS is clean with less junk and far better in performance than other OS by respective companies like MIUI, OneUI etc.
4)90 Hz Fluid AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution of 2400 X 1080 - Videos and games feel ever so smooth.
5) Gaming - its not a gaming centric phone by any extent like Asus ROG 2 but gets the job done and has even higher benchmark performance score than the ROG 2. The Adreno 640 GPU can handle the games at pretty high graphics setting @60 fps too.
6) The feature of Gestures makes life a hell lot of easier for me.
7) The UFS storage 3.0 makes copy and paste operations much more smoother and faster.
8) The 30T warp charger is just amazing. 0 to 70% in 30 mins and 0 to 100% in 50 mins.

Every smartphone however great will always have some cons these are:-

1)No 3.5mm headphone jack - OnePlus deliberality does this to cut costs so that it can pack up the phone on other features.
2) No SD card slot - when u have the UFS Storage 3.0 you dont really need a SD card slot. OnePlus claims it slows down the phone.
3) Battery - well larger battery doesn't always mean more screen time as seen in Google Pixel or even Iphone where battery is not very big but they have great power backup and screen time. Same is with OnePlus 3800 mAh can get the job done in most number of days but still feels a bit less when you are performing GPU intensive stuff for a long time like gaming.
4) Camera - the only thing this phone lags behind as compared to other smartphones in the same price range is the camera. OnePlus has failed to impress me with the Camera on this phone. At this price range they are only giving EIS and 2x zoom with only a 16MP front selfie camera. While taking broad daylight photos you may notice that the colour may be oversaturated to some extent( a red flower may appear pink in photos). Low light photos at night look superb though. If you are looking for a better camera phone then OnePlus 7T may not be your choice.
5) Notch design - Some people may like it some may not its your own personal preference. I personally do not like it because it obscures the display of some apps and videos.
6) No official IP rating :- well you are never sure when the phone may give up when it is exposed to water as there is no official IP rating. So use it carefully in rainy season especially. OnePlus says its next smartphones will all have official IP rating."
Nice
Its basically a good phone for the users who doesn't use much phone...it has good battery life but when we talk about features it is not much satisfying..its fingerprint scanner is ok ok but face unlock is not up to mark (WORST)...it also has a LITTLE bit Lagging or hanging problem and if your are gonna to buy it for games then make sure your mind because you can't play games(PUBG) as frequent as you can in other mobile
Happy Mothers Day! i hope tom got you something special! enjoy day!  xo
Very poor because it's several time hangs and face unlock feature much slow in light but in night very fast. Internet speed much slow.
Don't buy from this seller.re-sealed items previously opened getting sold with accessories missing.neither Amazon responded clearly on this and the seller didn't even reply.
Good phone with insane selfie camera
Nice mobile
"This place is as good as it gets for shooting.   I became a full member today after also researching Shooter's World, Phoenix Rod & Gun, and Scottsdale Gun Club (where I will also become a member).   The cost is VERY reasonable at $85/year ($110 after adding the initial administrative fee).

The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.  

I'm really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend."
We have better option in this price. I bought seeing the name VIVO. But it is overheating
"Good phone, good display, powerful processor, I am satisfied"
"I purchased One Plus 7T on 15th March 2020 initially i experienced good performance with this devise but today that is 1st April 2020 all sudden my mobile got off and not switching on even after trying full charge several times and the sad part is i am unable to reach out to Amazon or even buyer ,it is expensive devise and very bad to see that it got lapse with in 15 days of its purchase ....

Must buy at this price"
"battery life is awesome
camera make a perfect shot"
Best phone till now that I have used since long. I am the biggest fan of OnePlus and I have used each and every model of the Onplus from oneplus x to oneplus 7T/7 Pro
"This is one of the best samsung phones I have used. It has good performance in gaming,browsing and everything seems very fast in the phone. The camera is good and even portrait mode is provided as many of the previous samsung phone are not given. The face recongnition and fingerprint are very fast and work in split second. The main and my favourite feature of this phone is battery life. The battery performance is extraordinary and lasts forever. I charge my phone every alternative day and the charging time is also very less. This is one of the best phones in this price range other than any other brand phones."
Processor is worth for the money
Phone doesn't work. It's home screen is blinking again and again. Atleast 10 times in 3 seconds. Not able to use brand new phone on first day
We got damage piece and we charging is also not up to mark
"It's different to advertisement. It have problems in network IC, slow processing, earphone not provided by company, low sound, poor quality ring tones, hanging problems, camera quality is medium compared to other brands as Sony, Apple, Google, Redmi, Oppo, etc"
Twenty minutes on a **** call you would think that the person would mention there is already a trouble ticket investigating the issue
Great Product in a great price tag. The best thing about this phone is Amoled Display and Indisplay fingerprint.
Good
"Excellent quality & service, Oneplus mobile Brand handset. Really Never settle"
The product is too good best phn till date. Graphics and processor is very good.Super phn must buy. Camera can be better but super quality images..... better compared to redmi oppo

"Don't buy waste of money.
1.Phone is very heating in normal use also.
2.Back finger print area surrounding body plastic is not proper fixed.
3.Very cheep type plastic body.
4. For this Exnos 9611 prossser 6000 Mah battery is not enough. 10000 Mah batter require dew to over heating.
5.Battery charging for full taken 3 Hrs.
Totally my opinion don't buy..wait for Redmi 9pro/Max."
Very nice Phone. Mi is the best. I love to use the smart phone. Thanks
"Awesome experience. The camera, display and battery life are amazing. However there are some software glitches and I hope one plus will fix them soon."

"After using for about
 1 month, I am very much happy for owning such a wonderful phone.. Camera quality is exceptional.. Especially Macro shots  are superb. Bought this phone just for macro shots and very much happy abt the quality!! Battery backup is superb and speed charging is good.."
"This phone is overall good for its camera quality, battery backup and its processor. Camera quality is great compared to other phones of this price range. Processor is very fast, as you can open up 4-5 apps in pop up window and the phone dosen't even lag a bit, not to mention gaming- smoothest gameplay you could ever get in this price range.
All that aside the best feature is its battery backup, with a full charge your phone will easily last about 2-3 days over its normal day to day usage.
Fast charging dosen't satisfy much as it takes around 2 hours to charge from 30-100%.
If you're ordering online, make sure to add to cart a tampered glass and back cover along with it, as these are not included in the box, also make sure its of good quality becausethe glass may brake if the phone hits the ground with the corner side.
In short, its an awesome phone and you'll definitely love it..."
"Very good product at this price tag, I got it at 7200 in great india sale"
My M30s phones battery has given problem in 2 months. Phone is unable to charge after I updated phone. I had to give my phone to service center. Very bad phone. Wrong choice.
I love this phone. Its all feature is too good camera also too good.
"This dude claims he ""steals souls for a living"" and is ""the best photographer"". In the world. Ever.  

http://www.flickr.com/people/tysoncrosbie/

I promise--there is nothing at all vain, hacky, narcissistic, overpriced or arrogant, whatsosever, about Tyson Crosby or his work.

Phoenix should consider itself fortunate to be home to such a phenomenally over-talented, artistic genius.  Big art cities like NYC, Chicago and LA would never be able to fully appreciate the photographic brilliance of the one, the only, the premier best photographer in the world-Tyson Crosby.

Humble, poetic and unpretentious as he may be, I can't argue with him. The fist time I saw a Tyson Crosbie image, I j!zzed in my pants. Really, his work is that good. For real. No joke. I'm serious. Totally serious.  I love his work so much, I want to marry a Tyson Crosby print.

good phone in this price range
The camera doesnt have clearity and not seems 48 mp. After the testing was done by amazon software that was found the camera have some isue. It doesnt zoom nor shows clear images. After zooming the clicked picture.. It was found that the basic fone of 5k  bought 2 yrs back brand 10.or camera has better zoom n camera  n pixel clearity then this so called 48mp camera.. I was able to read the texts of images from 10 or camera but not from m30s. Both was clicked from Same place in same light conditions
Fabulous mobile with normal cost. Excellent features mainly camera is tooo good and battery long lasting...
Nice phone excellent price.
My goodness! I go single and **** goes crazy! Haha. **** this. I like being single too much. I do what I want...holla!
I like the battery and the camera which is ultimate.
"Looks good, sound nice,camera quality is nice
,Battery back up is awesome and battery charging is fast not as turbo chargers but fast no one can't face any trouble with battery but it's only issues is that it's working slow on first day of use it hanging on lots of area with out any  games installed in it only on just normal use like YouTube ,other browsing very dissatisfied from it's  processor speed
One star for looks,one for camera,one for battery back up and two star deducted for slow processing becoz what features we can use when it got hang."
"It’s a good phone. But till you don’t update the software the play store doesn’t work. Besides you can download the apps from galaxy store. Camera quality is not as good as we had thought of, when compared Iphone range."
My system is got corrupted automatically and now it is in idle and repair made. Heat up very early. For some of the text field there is no enter key or submit button is available.

"This place was great. When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at ""The BEST pizza in the country"" i Was skeptical. Best pizza in Phoenix? Well, I wasn't disappointed! 

We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu:
Apps:
Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese
Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm 
Pizza:
MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil 
MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese) 
ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios 
SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives 
BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula 
WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage 

Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite! I don't eat pork, so I couldn't sample them all, but I'd happily order this one again. In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this.

Their house draft beer is also quite tasty!

Tip - if you are a party of 6-10, get a reservation! They don't take reservations for smaller groups and I've heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times! But worth it!"
Good
Nice ...in cost

It gives me more time to use my phone instead of charging repeatedly and also a good fingerprint sensor. But dislike is its sound is not too aloud.
"RT @RWSurferGirl: It is very disappointing that Fox News is not conducting a ""Fair &amp; Balanced"" Debate. 🇺🇸 #GOPDebate  #GOPDebates"
It's awesome & unbelievable in this price range.
Value for money.good battery backup and good camera
Good product

mine too <3
Overall good
is starting to get this whole Twitter thing!
" Haha, you didn`t do anything wrong."
"Had great expectations after highly recommended by others. The breakfast was good, nothing extraordinary though. The service was a disappointment, server was very forgetful and put off by some simple requests. It doesn't look like they need my business though, considering the line to get in. I probably wont be back."
"I received a faulty phone, network and WiFi connection goes on and off automatically. And When I called Amazon they said first their technician will check in next 3 days and after that replacement process will go on till that I have to wait, don't knw how long it going to take 😠😠😠
I used it for two days and noticably Battery and camera performance is poor not a flagship level of course."
agreed
"I dislike this ill country which made whole world ill and trying to become a superpower, which is only a dream and only will be a dream, I request everyone to not buy Chinese products as they are no reliable and they should be boycotted at every platform."
First of all I would like to say that don't buy this from Amazon as I got used product because it has minor scratch beside charging port and mobile is previously opened. Secondly it has worst battery backup
hahaha. I think you`re pretty far from me. Maybe next time though
Really amazing product... thanks Amazon
Very good for valuable amount
Improve finger print
Secend speaker not working (jiska use nhi hai vo kyu dikha rahe ho)
"The most concerning thing about this phone is the battery life.  The battery life could have been better, comparing the rivels.  The worst flagship phones that had weaker battery performance have resolved this issue, but I wonder why OnePlus did not see it as a concern. I have bought this 7T after having used Redmi Note 4 for 2 years; I have had premium smartphones in the past, such as iPhone 3Gs, 4, Samsung Note 3.

I am totally happy with the performance with the only cons being an average battery life.  Redmi's battery was overwhelmingly good with a decent performance.

I am using battery saver option during work so that I have enough juice left till I reach home. The Warp charger is a saviour.  With battery saver option, I am able to sail through the day to bedtime.

The call quality, speaker and signal reception are good even at basements and underground metro stations.

Oxygen OS is close to stock android and snappy most of the time.  Additionally, OnePlus is offering free extended warranty for 1 year for all its customers having models from OnePlus 6 onwards, which is a great marketing strategy."
Good phone good price
Camera is worst
"Writing review after using for 3weeks.
Superfast fingerprint sensor, nice low light photography from front camera. Rear camera is also pretty much Good but wide angle shots quality is poor as it only uses 5MP camera for it. Portrait mode is also good. Super crystal clear selfies at outdoors. Battery life is good. SuperAmoled display makes viewing experience superb. Supports 5GHz WiFi transmission whereas M30 doesn'twhich is not mentioned in specifications. Faster processor no lag in opening any window.
Lowest SAR value means lower radiation emission hence more safe.
Cons
Rear cover looks classy much better than that shown in the photo but its plastic body hence catches scratches easily.
Not received Android pie & Samsung one UI update whereas lower J series started receiving it however Samsung said they will update soon.
Poor wide angle shots quality."
Chocolate milk is so much better through a straw. I lack said straw
Oh no! Hope you find your voice soon
"False ads, do not stay there. Unless you don't mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor ""cabana suites"" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The ""suites"" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an ""out of order"" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!"
The phone is really good with this price
can you follow me so I can DM you?
"It's been a week that I've gifted this phone to my dad and he is pretty happy and satisfied with the 5000 Mah battery, fast charging, fast processing, good camera & sound quality."
Good but not best in price and features
Very bad product
"I have been using Xiaomi note 3 since it's release. I wanted to upgrade in same family of phones. I couldn't had better product which always goes for value for money. This is a great phone with great battery life, camera
Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for phone within the budget of 20k"
Battery quality is not up to the mark. Getting drained out early.
"Woken up finally after a long night out, tea, toast and TV coming up..."
Good
Very good
Heavy weight on this mobile
 Camera Quality Needs to be Improve''' For Night Shoot or Low Light . I try to Record this video on Game Launcher '''' I cant see the numbers'  After play Games mobile was hang ( PUBG) half display icons gone
Are they trying to knock out Paul and Trump by asking them all of the questions? #GOPDebates many are getting ignored
Nice

Good in lowest price
"It is a very average product, batery life span is very bad in compre with its capacity & specially, the touch screen quality is wrost . It take a much long time  response. Don't buy this product."

Oh... I miss the Piano.
Quality is so good one
at that price mobile is perfact...go ahead...
"I had been wanting to come back for a while.  I love this restaurant.  Last night we had a magnificent meal.  I started with the St. Francis Lemonade, a perfect cocktail to start your meal.  There are so many wonderful choices.  They are featuring a special menu for New Years, however you can order from it ""a la carte"", so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad.  It was delicious.  I love the combination of dates, goat cheese and orange slices.  I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops.  WOW, they were so sweet and tender.  They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.  The portion was generous, 5 scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.  I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).  I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.  I had a bite of his and it was great.  I cannot guarantee I won't stick to my usual dessert, but it was a closed one.  I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live.  It is such a great place."
Fully loaded . Value for money..
Awesome mobile camera was too goood
"Camera issues- Not excellent camera. It has 64MP primary and 20 MP secondary for only name or paper.
Slow motion- Not work properly. And very bad in artificial light like if you want to take slow motion video in room with very good light nevertheless you can't take because very bad. I'm very disappointed with this.

I'm using this for two days and if I think this good then I will keep with me otherwise will return the same. I want to see any other problems with this phone."
Nice phone. Fast response
"Product qwality is very bad , I feel it's fake product , burst experience with redmi note 8
Quad Camera setup but picture qwality blur and shaky always showing fluctuations light lines in artificial light very bad experience

Processor is slow always facing signals problem

Strongly not recommended this product please"
Fast charging no
"Awesome mobile with great features. What I like most is, its camera quality and slow and ultra slow motion video recording. This mobile gives a great touch screen experience and has a excellent fingerprint sensor."
"Value product, if you just use your phone for calls, mails, messages, and browsing. This is a good option, I bought it with exchange and it cost me only 5300 including credit card offer."
"Battery life on the Redmi Note 8 Pro is also good enough for an entire day, and that can be attributed to a highly optimised MIUI interface and a large 4500mAh battery. ... Cameras have been the focus for Xiaomi since the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Note 8 Pro offers one of the most versatile camera setups of any phone."
Value for money
"Disappoint with camera performance
Camera does not perform well in light"
Ekdam faltu....
Heating problems  is h big problem

"RT @Lrihendry: #TedCruz As President, I will always tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.  #GOPDebates"
Nice
Phone is good but Camera is not so good...
Using from 3 months no heating issue. Long battery. Good to go with samsung as brand already used n trusted. Battery backup n charging is mastered in device with widest n bright clear display as compare to rivals. Fun to watch movie n play games with big sound speakers.
"I have many complaints

1) It's (m30)marketed as exynos 7904 processor but , I got a unit with exynos 7885 processor . This is main cheating .

2)There is no light sensor , (I know front camera act as light sensor) but it's speed is pathetic I have adjust brightness every time . Shame for device of 15000 Rs cost .

3)Even after taking calls screen will not lit up automatically I have to manually do it(because of lack of light sensor and poor quality of proximity sensor ).

4) Speaker volume is not good (compare to old Samsung feature phones) and sound cracks more often . Head phone volume is low and it's not having good quality like old Samsung phones .

5)Ultra wide angle camera quality is waste it's 5mp wide angle so no details in pictures at all .

6) No native support for using amoled screen as led notification light . Have to use NoLED third party app.

7) 13MP main camera fully waste . Pictures taken have short range clarity but doesn't have details of distance objects (remember my old Motorola g4 get more detailed distance shots). I think camera module is not up to the mark (cost cutting ???)

8) status bar fonts are very small and no option to add extra icons like internet speed etc , there is no option in setting to increase status bar font .

9) data toggle buttons ( between to two Sims ) is not available in notification bar.

10) Samsung Galaxy apps always runs in background and collecting your information ,  no option for galaxy apps to stop in background and apply battery optimization. Often ""install galaxy apps "" ad pops up very annoying .

11) Even phone colour theme cannot be changed unless you  buy Samsung Galaxy themes

12) Exynos processor means to no custom ROM development.

13)Fragile screen with no screen protection (dragon tail is there but no good).

14) fast charger is total waste , you can't get much charge in short time so no 5 min charge and talk 2 hours like feature .

15)  No otg support for laptop hard disc with external case ( even some old phones support other for hard disc).

16)No correct size external cases and tempered glass support ."
" wahahahaha!! i wanna naaaaa!!! well...hapit na i guess. hahahaha ) yes, now we all know!!! hahahaha lol ) NARN! haha joke"

One minus headphone missing and other headphone unable to attend call otherwise 100% worth for buying"
"is boiling in the office, air con any1 ?"
The phone gets heated very quick and in summer days it would evenly burn your ears while talking on call. Overall the phone is good but the heating problem is the worst part of this phone.
"is now following Chester Bennington, awesome!"
"Camera quality is good.

"I was working in the area and craving a healthy salad for lunch. My usual love affair salad place was too far so my colleague and I decided to try Jason's Deli. He'd gone there for sandwiches many times and never tried the salad bar. For about $7.50 after tax you can get a pretty good selection of veggies, dressings, even a few pre-made pasta salad options. They also have crackers and mini muffins. The salad area seemed clean and well stocked. There were enough tables to sit, even during the lunch rush."
"I've bought this phone in first sell. MI A3 is just amazing. Wonderful phone  under 15K just like MI A3, I've never seen.
Camera quality amazing, Processor just a have wonderful quality, battery quality and life is super. Overall this phone is very good.
I've used Note 6 Pro, Redmi Y2, Redmi Y3 and note 5 pro before this phone. But it's quality is wonderful... I'll recommend you for buy this phone.."
"If I could give zero stars, I would. Just about the worst experience for my friend and I. We came in for a quick and easy dinner.  After being ignored at the door way repeatedly, we sat ourselves.  First, we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus, but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back. Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving. I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone. They're lazy, slow, and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there.  The happy hour prices are great, but there are other RA's so do yourself a favor and go to a different location."
All good....masttttt in this price range
"Best camera, best display, best network, best brand, best value for money and best ui, if you know how to use it. Stupid people say bad comments on ui because they don't even try to check features and don't even try to learn ui. It is much better than most other ui"

Pros
Good battery life.
Great display.

Cons
Camera could be better.
Fingerprint sensor could be much more responsive.

Overall its a good package under 10000 and you will definitely love this phone if you are not a heavy user."
_west one day the hubs and I WILL take one of those. There`s actually a missions cruise that we want to go on. It has music too.
Camera quality could be more better
Stuck on NJ Transit for the past twenty minutes. Great way to start the week
Display and Over all Mobile is Best In this Price Range

The phone got an update that crashed and made it unusable. Letdown by samsung in lockdown.
"LIGHTS OUT Before curfew , curl up with the latest bestseller and treat your eyes to the perfect reading light from Luceplan ."

"Worst mobile i used till date.
Not user friendly
Will never buy any samsung products from now on"
Good
Great phone at minimum. Battery backup is also good.Best phone at this price range
"Fingerprint reader, Camera,  Battery both are good.."
"I wouldn't give a penny more then 5000 RS for such stupid creation . I mean a branded phone ls can give you a lot more. I am not getting into the hi-tec reviews that many do but to make life simple.

If you use your phone for selfies then avoid this as the phone has bugs and software issues. Mi customer service is terrible which only adds to it. The camera has a huge lag and if u think I shud have checked the settings then let me tell u I have even googld enough to find solutions.

If you use hotspot then this phone will die in 3hrs flat.

The phone's battery is not great at all.

Screen is HD but even dumb phones consume much lesser battery for a good screen illumination whereas this crap requires u to set the screen brightness at Max. Mi probably thinks that u operate the phone in 25 hrs daylight

Ur what's app will be a nightmare if u want to send selfies images.

Synchronization is another issue which I am trying to solve

Overall avoid this phone.. I'm not even going to the lack of network connectivity , no audio jack, no SD card... Blah blah blah..

BUY AN UNBRANDED PHONE BUT NOT AN MI CRAP"

"I frequent RnR quite a bit for happy hour.  I've been here tons of times since I moved to AZ.  Definetly one of the best happy hours in old town.  Happy hour from 4-7 LOVE IT (I get mad when places are 3-6- who gets off work that early??).  And pretty every drink is on special during happy hour.  Really cheap wine, beer, and liquor.  
Ya their food isn't orgasm AMAZING but it's pretty good.  I've havn't disliked anything I've tried there.  
I love the atmosphere and outdoor patio on both levels.
I've been for breakfast too and the bottomless mimosas are wonderful.  They keep em coming.  The food is good breakfast food.  
I take family/friends from out of town here for happy hours.
I love this place I don't get what the hate is about!"

Using it for a week. Good battery for heavy user  too. Not great for gaming. High quality pictures and videos could be captured.
"When I walked in we were greeted instantly. The place smelled a bit like a hole in the wall but nevermind that. We were happy to come in to happy hour. Galbi for $11.95. Whoop! Thankfully we were the only people there because there was only one server. I ordered the galbi and parents ordered the bulgogi. They also ordered a mango and mocha boba. Ten minutes in more people trickled in. and then this is where the service started to get slow. We got our appetizer no problem. Then side dishes. Ten minutes later the entrees were ready. However, it took him 5 minutes to get our rice. 
Another waitress showed up and we thought things would go smoother. We asked for our bobas and her response was ""he's by himself and working on it"".  I didn't like this response considering we had already been there 20 minutes without any drinks we ordered. 

Overall we enjoyed the food but just not impressed with speed and service."

"This place used to be quite good but I think they may have had an ownership change recently.  Over the past 12 months or so we have seen the quality of the food and service level both drop to unacceptable levels.

The food is overall average - the fajitas down right poor and the drinks very inconsistent.  They do get somewhat busy with a bar crowd but that too seems inconsistent so when they do get busy the service gets very bad.

When service deteriorates the Manager (or owner, I'm not sure) seems to hide from customers. 

Overall, make the trip down to Shea Blvd and find much better at better prices."
"It's the best phone under 10000 I think it is far better than redmi note 7 pro
Go for it guys"
Awesome phone worth the price
"Camera is not good in low light, else is nice"
my deep fry drumsticks were not as good as i thought they would be
Overall is good low price and I
Very  cool and awesome phone every feature is mind blowing  it has multiple account in one app feature too camera quality is best and screen is too awesome video quality ultra hd
"Mobile gets hung, battery will get heated if call duration is more than 10min and more. Battery life is ok."
"This is my Dream Mobile which I was waiting eagerly Camera, Display, Processor"
Good product
just going through some of his tracks in iTunes and buying his awesome tracks I don`t have. Loving it
Awesome food. Highly recommend. Had gyros platter . Generous portions and excellent meat.  Check out their spices and other food stuff. Got couscous very cheap.
Great in this price range. Liked it.
Excellent at this price point. Very capable set of cameras and a beautiful Amoled display.
"Great, superb job , arrive on time phone looks good"
Amazon reallly sucks....the worst customer service ever....they should be awarded for worst ever
"Best phone for this price range.
Go for it. Need not say much. Any doubts refer Google."
Overall good phone
Thank You Clayton. Going to my favorite Greek Resturant after church for mom`s Day!!!!  Loved you on Huckabee

Value for money not best
"RT @benwikler: So, was @SenSchumer throwing his hat in the #GOPDebate ring by coming out on the GOP side of the #IranDeal debate tonight?"
Worst phone  . It is not a Samsung. This is poor 💩 quality product
Both front and back camera poor. Touch not working many attempts. Poor return police.  I tried to return the product but it asked me to go some app for filling return the product.
"Camera poor quality, Amazon pr mobile phone me kuch problem hone pr technician ghar pr bhejenge pr mobile change nhi hoga."
"The phone specifications are definitely enticing especially for this price. The battery life seems accurate depending on your usage. However the fingerprint reader could've been better. The recognition is not the problem. What is bothersome is the fact that your finger takes a while to locate the lens when you aren't directly looking at it. This is because the lens does not protrude outward and hence becomes difficult to feel its location. It's not really a con once you get the hang of it. You can avoid this problem with a decent back cover that creates a significant depth to the lens, which in turn becomes easy for your finger to feel and locate it accurately. Apart from that the phone is a worthy purchase for its cost."
"I seen first time battery , camera are very good quality"
I came here today for a manicure and pedicure... I have been here quite a few times; it is a place my girlfriends like to come to so when I want to hang with my girlfriends and get a mani/pedi this is where we meet.  Although today I was solo:(.  The ladies here do a really good job; my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating.  Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure... now that is what I call service!  I was out of there in a hour.  They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip.  Today I did not have cash ( i forgot)  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want.  I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great.  Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure.  Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was $42.00.
Battery backup is not good because my m30 which have 5000mah battery is last better than this despite being 6000mah battery

Thoughts: Staff was friendly and quick, nice place, very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well.

Chicken salad bagel sandwich wasn't too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - I'd probably eat it again however.  Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum!  I'm wanting to go back to try different menu items now :)"

Best phone in the price range Of 13k.  It's All in one power pack and one must definitely go for it without a second thought ❤️❤️❤️
I generally don’t write reviews. But this phone has taken all my patience out. 2 months and it’s not working. Samsung service centre says the board has got complaint. Battery too not working. They said a new phone can’t be provided. Only thing is they can send to some random service centre. Pathetic phone pathetic service. Samsung yet again proves apart from their Galaxy S9 S10 series all other phones are just crap!

"Samsung Galaxy M30 ! Amazing phone
Purchased this phone on Aug 17th 2019.

Things I liked about this phone
1. The phone came with Android 9 pie out of the box (Yes, Android 9 Pre-installed) (Phone manufactured Aug 2019)
2. The display is simply awesome, amazing super AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution
3.  Battery! 5k mAh battery last 2 days on moderate to heavy use.
4. Phone is not heavy even with 5000 mah battery.
5. Always on Display in enabled on this device (Truly a great feature for me)
6. Dark screen mode is present.
7. Type C port.
8. 15W Fast charger present inside the box.
9. No hybrid slot (dedicated 2 sim and Mirco SD)
10. Triple rear camera.
11. Trust of big brand like Samsung, unlike cheap Chinese phones.
12 . Good RAM management , I worked seamlessly with 10 apps opened.
13. Processor is good for regular daily use, I do not play much games, those who want to play games they may look for better processor phones.

Things I think that could have been better:
1. Camera quality could have been better.
2. Glass back would have made the phone even more premium.
3. No headphone inside the box.

Overall a great purchase!
Just go for it Guys!

Thanks!"
it's k
"I purchased the product on 5th Feb, writing review on 21st may.
Pros: good display, good UI, good ram management,  excellent battery, decent camera.
Cons:
The first and the foremost quality of any MOBILE PHONE IS TO MAKE PHONE CALLS, AND THIS HAS THE WORST, IT FAILS TO MAKE CALL IN FIRST ATTEMPT MOST TIMES, I NEED TO RESTART TO GET NETWORK. EVEN WHEN IM STANDING NEAR THE TOWER. IT DOES NOT EVEN CATCH THE 4G NETWORK.
Sometimes fails to detect finger print.
Bad speakers, not even properly audible in full volume. On earphones it's great with Dolby atmos."
what was said?
Sim 1 is not getting sufficient/proper network/signal.Even calling is not possible.
Extremely poor as default apps are useless and cannot be removed
"Some times finger print acceptance was too late,cam good, battery life also good...
But No call recording..."
"Not good, having touch problem, network receptor is not good, not able to listen voice of caller suddenly in between of call."
Value for Money and phone works good. Edges and slow motion camera not as expected. It will capture maximum of 1 minute.
I`m still waiting for the Oprah touch
"Everything I found value for money. 7T is best among 7, 7PRO and 7T. I can see some rainbow effect on screen when seen from angle. Also camera color scheme change when you switch between lens.
Though using Amazon from long time, disappointed by their corrupt practice this time with this phone. Phone was on sale from 28th Sept 12 PM. Placed order on same date but received only on 4th October. Review for this product was disabled till 3rd, I guess no one received till then. I can assume they don't have stock on 28th Sept but put this device on sale with fabricated delivery date. Not expected"
"Vaisala Oyj Press Release September 30 , 2010 Vaisala has signed a contract to sell its oxygen measurement technology and business to SICK Maihak GmbH ."
"The best mobile, camera and batter life is excellent"
"Camera quality is very poor, don't purchase from Amazon , it is not return."
watching supernatural  those boys can hunt me any day <3 haha
It's value for money
"The specifications mentioned for this product are not convincing as it has been shown.
It hangs a lot.
Fast charging is in reality not as fast as it has to be and even camera quality is average.
finger print sensor is i think worst amongst all the mobiles which i had earlier used."
Very nice
"Stora Enso 's business in North America has annual capacity of about 3 million tons and employs about 4,350 people ."
IN THE SECOND DAY SINCE I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT... THE PHONE GOT SWITCHED OFF AUTOMATICALLY . AGAIN ONCE I TRIED TO CLICK PICTURES THE CAMERA DIDN'T WORK.DONT KNOW WHAT IS THE REASON.  I RECOMMEND ALL GUYS... GOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
Very good Phone with poor battery life.
Camera
"I am not happy at all as the battery is not at all giving any backup  as promise. 6000mah sounds good but it lasts only a day..and I dont have any heavy game and run only fb, YouTube and Instagram. I even tried optimizing yet the backup is not more than a day. Wrong promise from Samsung. Camera is good, with 8GB ram performance of the device is not at all that good. I have used this mobile for 2 months now..and for the price the performance is bad.."
"  Im good ta. bit tired cos i`ve been wking all wkend but other than that, all good  How`s you?"
Good product
good
product is not good to use i want to return and but another product against this
Its not that product what i am aspecting from samsung. As usual samsung nhi sudharega. I am contieously restarting this phone as its lack data speed. My suggestion - go for any brand  other than samsung.its a worst phone don't ever thi k to buy it

"The phone works Amazing. I was using one plus 3 before buying this product. One plus is becoming bigger and better. The phone is smooth runs efficiently even if there are multiple apps running at the background.I transferred the entire data through one plus switch app and it took 20 minutes to transfer 40 Gb data. the finger print scanner and face recognition features are just cool. The battery has a great back up. It doesn't exhaust easily. The phone box contained a silicone case and a prefit tempered glass. The phone interface is new and different than other Samsung Smartphones which looks alike.. The company offered one year screen replacement through acko insurance which is a blessing in disguise.
Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.."

"I was in Vietnam last May, and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up, so to qualify my 5 stars, ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""  I say to what's available of what I've seen in PHX area.  With that said, I've had the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Tai, Com Tam Dac Biet, Bun bi cha gio, and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness, freshness of condiments, integrity of broth ( lack of oiliness ), and general flavor.  The only thing that didn't rock my world was the bahn mi sandwiches- can't vouch for the assorted outsourced items in the chilled section either.  Besides that, If you want Viet food this is your place for the PHX metro area."
Over heating problems and Amazon replace process is very painful
Great buy
Hey speaker volume is very low...  sumtimes i cant hear wat other person is talking while in call...
lmao!!! ummm duh gurl I need to buy me some more v-necks I like em!!!
Hanging problem
"OK type Phone.
I bought it on very high expectation.
In summary my review is as below:
Display - 4/5
Speed - 3/5 or 2.5/5 considering 2GB ram it is slower. IT consume a lot of memory itself.
Stability - 2/5
Battery - 2/5
Built - 3/5
Look - 4/5
Software - 3/5"
"Samsung M30 is best phone at average price. I am enjoying phone since it launched and found much better at this cost.
Camera is good with limited options to take photo more effectively. Selfie camera is also average.
Battery life of phone is fantastic. For normal use I did not need to plug in for 2 or 3 days. Also it gets fully charged in hour or two.
Since, I have not used any high performance app in my phone but with all essential application it works very smoothly."
"Really say the quality of phone is not good but the screen is very good and speaker is normal but the signal  strength  of sim like 2G
Speed of internet  is too slow on 4g area on any operator..
Points table:-

Camera  :-  7/10
Display  :-  9/10
Signal strength  :- 3/10
Proseccsor :- 6/10
Multitask  :-  5/10
Speaker  :-  4/10
Design  :-  2/10
Fingerprint sensor  :- 4/10
Face recognition  :-  6/10

Thank you All"

"It seems this is nice product when compared with new release with Samsung that time ...
But now so many vesions released with so many features ...so that it very low quality ...better chose another one"
"Battery life is hell, took 1hr to charge then 10%

Amazon didn't listened to any complaint at all

very bad service"
Seller sent me a dead phone and they do not have replacement🤬
"Pros:
Built quality : 8 out of 10.
Sound : 8 out of 10 .
Camera both back & front : 10 out of 10.
Value for money : 10 out of 10.
Cons:
No finger print sensor but it has facelock .
A bit heavy but less heavier than Redmi Note 8 ( which I use ) .
Overall it's a very good phone from Redmi .

Thanks Team Amazon India."
Valuable product
Best mobile📱 under rate
Camera not working
Network signal connectivity is very poor. After 3 month charging  problems  start. And battery  also not work as its capacity.  Battery discharge automatically  in 10 hours
"Amazing and a power full phone. Camera quality is great, low light photography is also very good. Battery life is decent and depends on your usage. Performance wise simply outstanding. The face detection is so quick, that you will not realise how fast the phone unlocks. The on screen fingerprint reader is also pretty good and quick. But the face detection response time beats everything. Using this phone from about more than a month and very happy to have chosen one plus 7t."

"Zipps has good bar food, but the service is usually horrible. The waitresses rarely come to your table. BUT, what really rubs me the wrong way is this....
On multiple occasions, when I pay the bill, the waiter doesn't bring me back the correct change. Even if my change is 1 cent, I'm entitled to receive my money back. 
I'm sorry, but not giving me back my  change because you deem it insignificant doesn't float well with me. They do have great food though."

Gorilla Glass 5 for protection and handy design to operate from a single hand.
Good sound quality- media as well as calling.

Cons-
The in-display fingerprint sensor is slow( takes 1-2 sec to unlock).
screen 720p but oversaturated due to AMOLED.
The processor is OK but not made for Gamers ( I played Call of duty at medium setting it worked fine)."

The drinks were $9 and were supposed to be ""top shelf"" uh I thinks not. tasted very watered down and I decided to limit myself to one at that price to quality ratio. The only part of the experience that was worth while the observing the table sitting next to us. Listening to them bicker back and fourth and argue about what they were going to get was quite entertaining....... I would not recommend going there for anyone there is plenty of other options close by that will leave you satisfied"

Worst phone ever I bought. I ordered the phone in 1st day of lunch. I got timely delivery but  After using for 29 days phone got hang up while updating software.

Even I let the phone to get switch off by itself after consumption of battery still showing same while charging.Now I can't return it because they say return period were till 27th march.

It's totally drug-infested, They don't keep their word.  I would skip it."
Good battery life
"I'll start with the positive.  They have some friendly members of staff.  That's it.  You might catch a staff infection here, so watch out.  It's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence.  I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as it's his favourite dive.  It's one wrong glance away from a fight, every time.  If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you, go for it.  If not, avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else."
that is sickening... Just shoot at will? Smh... Prayers for his family...
Loved it
"I was using the mobile in last two months, Good Performance, long battery life, Camera pic was awesome.
I played few games good for game players. Good product."

"Atleast we expect good build quality n durability after spending arround 50,000/-.
Backglass of my phone broke badly due to accidental fall even from table height (approx 3 feet), back cover was in place place though...replace the glass at approx cost of 3000/-..
then I bought rhinoshield bumper case with front and back impact flex screen guard...claimed to protect phone upto 11 meter fall..but this time when my mobile falls...it got front n back glass broken with damage to motherboard also!! Not expected this poor build quality at this price point..specially when rhinoshield case n screen protection was also there..now they claim repair cost of 49,000...as good a new!!!
Not at all durable..even after paying this much price..."

"Fingerprint is working as slow,
Camera is very worst quality ,
Battery only good in this mobile"
Bad bad bad!! Camera is not even 8 Megapixel. I still can't understand why this kind of huge company like SAMSUNG are about to misleading their customers  with fake numbers. I am too much upset with this. May be ill return the product.
Hangs all the time. I bought it thinking good product for less money but turned fool
The phone is nice. Battery backup is amazing. Picture quality is better. And other features of the phone are good. Fingerprints is working properly.
very bad experience
The last job losses related to these reductions will take place during 2010 .
In that package there is no headset... So pls check before buy
"Awesome camera and gud battery backup,,look is also cool"
Nice
Battery life not good.
so glad i`m not at uni anymore
"The biggest drawback is, the battery drains out really fast, which is unlike a One Plus phone.
There's a slight heating issue as well."
I just bought it for my mother shes not a techno freak so she loves the phone . Best display at this price . Camera does the job well . Overall nice package from samsung wound be better one if it had a better processor
excellent product on 10k range amazing features on this phone best of other phones. camera quality is good sound clarity is good im happy for this product

Don't go for it ..waist product
"For some reason, these people seem to think it's OK to price a tank top, that probably has less thread count than my thong and cost about 17cents of labor to make, at $50. 

They also seem to think that dressing up their mannequins like paraplegic color and pattern blind grandmas gives them business. Oh wait...it does! Because this is Tempe. And Tempe, as I can't over-repeat, is the devil."
I like this product
... but i could barely speak! He was probably thinking `who is the weirdo?` LOOOOL. Say sorry to him for me please?  x <3
During call it is going to be hold the call always.. Even after the factory reset and software updatings its not working.  Worst phone..
Don't buy this product its camera quality is very poor like 16 Megapixel and there is no return policy while u call amazon they said u contact to Samsung.
I like colour
"My experience is totally bad overall  -first the build quality is so cheap it totally bends/ scratches....and  i do not recommend this phone not to anyone and i think if I’m not wrong the whole m series is made of carbon fibre plastic ,I recommend A series rather than m series"
Camera quality low
This mobile is good. I bought it recently so this is good.
Top class performances. Killer from OnePlus. My 1st OnePlus device and i am enjoying it. Thank you OnePlus for true flagship.

Awww mate. that`s such a shitter
Samsung M30s is going to be released so that the flaws of this product are covered up. Nevertheless a better product unlike others in market.
Phone is ok not that much satisfied with this.. lot of sensors missing... even there is no option for net speed Status bar. Camara quality is just Ok. Battery is not good as expected..from 5000 mah.

Regarding charging it took some extra time to charge as compared SE.
Battery life goes 1.5 day.

I am not satisfied with amazon..They cheated me..In YouTube they showed so many varieties along with cute box headphones and wireless earphones etc..I am totally disappointed with amazon... Don't buy this product in Amazon
"Nothing special on this phone, previously used OPPO f9 pro, there is no difference.. camera was better in f9 pro. Very regular ..not impressed .."
From day one itself mobile  network not working properly always gives poor voice clarity . worst phone from samsung.
Camera results are excellent also the features of face recognition and fingerprint reader is also nice.  The best part is the battery life it is awesome
Good
Sir it's battery life is not good
Super
The touch screen of the phone is not working properly after the latest update. And the phone has hanging issues.
"Yes, it is a biker bar.  And it is packed with them at certain times, especially weekends.  I don't ride. But if you roll in on a weekday around noon you might not see any, and if everyone seems to know everyone it's because they are all friendly local folks. So if you're visiting Cave Creek don't assume the Hells Angels are there looking to kick ass   Most of the ""bikers"" probably drive BMWs during the week.  I stop in at least once a week for a bite.  The food is the best bar food in Cave Creek and the service is awesome. I've been to every bar in town. Harold's , The Chip, Toad, etc. all are good, but The Hideaway is the best."
Good and decent product.. Value for money thats all i can say.
It`s because we`re right
Good product received in good condition

"Stonecreek is a nice place to play, and the price is fair.  I do like the layout.  Fun but not gimmicky.  The scenery is nice, too.

I will have to agree with others about the ball vacuum (aka creek) running right through the middle of the course.  

The staff also seemed nice enough when I was there.  I'm not sure what others were complaining about.  Overall, it's a decent place to play, and its location makes it ideal if you're meeting people from the other side of town."

Everything else is good"

"Feeling a bit weary from a steady stream of travel, we decided to head over here for my favorite Rx, Pho.

A couple of summer rolls filled with shrimp, pork and vermicelli, dipped in the sweet peanutty sauce, a dash of their house hot sauce(a tad more fire than the ""cock"" sauce) and we were off to  a fine start. I was feeling better already.

The Pho arrived, and the aromas were simply intoxicating. After a short interlude of vaporized euphoria, we dug in, adding the usual lime, cilantro, basil, sprouts and aforementioned hot sauce. Commence slurping.

The broth was simple yet complex in layered flavors. Noodles were perfect in abundance and texture. My companion chose beef and shrimp and declared they were cooked perfectly. I selected the special beef which included shank, brisket, tendon, tripe and meatball. Outstanding.

Service was with a smile, prompt and attentive. I honestly felt like I was sitting in someone's home enjoying what they might eat on a daily basis. I do not think that Cyclo can compare, while good, this just seemed more authentic."
"Very poor
First time use me hi hanging problem
Return request is very bad
I m not satisfied amzon return policy"
I like this model but problem is that camera light shades are blue n red during video call don't know why?

Camera quality is too bad. It's like 5 megapixel front and 7 megapixel rear. I tried to return this but no one is picking phone. Amazon after sale service is too bad. There is written in that you can change or return but option are not working. I have proper video even phone box was already cutted near seal.
Ok

Great buy in this budget.
Decent camera quality.

Whom to contact for replacement ?"

I have already written but not respond my phone is hanging so please help for repair or replacement
"I love the features of the phone, camera, battery life, storage, processor. The only reason for one star is the phone delivered to me on 12 this month and I am having sound issues while playing media some times. It is pity if a 14 days old phone needs to visit service center.
This phone is also restarting automatically many times a day. What is wrong with the product."
me too.  it depresses me thinking about it.
"I still want to live here.  It's quite possibly the only vegan restaurant I could see myself flying here to eat at then going home.    

I've tried a number of things, and have come to the conclusion that this is the combination that will satisfy me each time:  

Green Burger with thyme fries and the Cookies n Cream Tsoynami.  

Their Green Burger trumps The Plant Cafe and Roam in SF--the only two places I've been to that somewhat mimic it (at least in color)."
"Worst product, not working properly charger panel, slow process. Totally not recommend to buy this product.
Dear amezon team please stop to promote this this type worst products. I paid RS.10500/- not a small amount...."

"So i'm not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, i'm here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial.

But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews can't be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot.

I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava. 

If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: don't. Really, don't. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it?

The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest i've ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless.

In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served."
Battery life expected more but slightly disappointment same as it's like redmi note 6pro

"I'm happy to report these cows gave their best for me to eat. Thank you dear moo cows thank you! These burgers are meaty goodness. Recently I went to a lunch with my bf, her sis and Ma on the fly for her b/day since her first choice failed to be open on a Sunday afternoon..... Not her fault their site said they would be open. Bastards shaking my fist in the air didn't update the site. 
D O U B L E Grrrrr! I suggested Zin since we were in the proximity. 
So this is my 3rd time at this place. While pricey the portions of everything are large in charge & good. The ingredients are fresh, the meat juicy and the fries are crispy as they should be in my opinion. Note to your mother! Do not waste the fat & gym time on the creme brulee shake. It's nothing more then a fancy name on a regular old vanilla shake. Having said that... I am a creme brulee fan so that may have been it's downfall. I was expecting greatness and fireworks etc. I got a really good vanilla shake though don't get me wrong but name it a vanilla shake. Don't market it as a creme brulee shake. How to improve it and bring a tear to my eye? Put a creme brulee hat on it. Gimmie the crunchy, sweet I'm looking for expect and demand. Just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake. The best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone on-line and having them show up and it's clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile. It is some one with a great personality and decent looks for sure just not the hottie. Still had a good time but my expectations were something else totally. The banana cream pie shake is de-lish and the Zin burger a def go. If you want a healthy choice go for the Tuna also very good and served perfectly rare. Mmmmm mmmm good."

"So I e-mailed East Maryland the same afternoon as my visit, explaining that I was disappointed that the coupon I had given them was not honored, and they e-mailed me back before the end of the day, apologizing and letting me know that my Visa would be credited the amount of the coupon. 

Then they called today to see how the boys were all doing after their shots, and acknowledged the bill issue again, and hoped that everything had been settled to my satisfaction.

This kind of immediate and friendly follow-up redeemed them and gained them another star."
"The thing about CPK I've noticed over the years, if you want adequate service, show up when it's not busy, because when it IS busy, plan on paying full price for drinks and meals that are completely and utterly lackluster.  CPK, do me a solid, if you run out of garnish for your $7.50 sangria's, let me know. I really look forward to that soaked pineapple and cherry, thank you very much! And please, don't think of it as audacious for me to request a dollar off for your mistake. Bottom line, won't return, and won't recommend this to anyone I love or even just moderately like."
Such a wonderful phone for me
"Electronic item, can defective, used for two/three days. Main reason to buy - Battery was not up to the mark even very poor. Long time to full charge and Battery Backup was not proper. So Samsung service Center recommended for return and replacement, after I cancelled my order. Couldn't take risk further with such high end product."
very poor phone ...not extend memory ..no memory slot.
" I will, n btw happy mothers day sissy"
No. 1 in design & excellent beautiful looks. Better option in this price range. Very fast delivered by Amazon in one day. More than white opal colour looks is great.

Very Good Phone
"This is best at the price. People following REDMI  Smartphone but this is really owsem phone comparing to the Mi . I will write these review using 1 month later m30 mobile

Big advantage
1) Amoled display.
2) Always on display.
3) 5000 Mah battery
4) Fast charging and 15W charger in the box.
4) Wide angle camera
5) No heating no lagging.
5) Face unlock is very fast.
6)  mobile look is attractive.
7) other phone SAR value is high but m30 SAR value is low
8) Blue light filter
9) Lock screen story and stunning pics.
10) triple real camera 13+5+5MP is owsem
11) 16MP front camera perfect for SELFI lover

FEEDBACK

1)People say camera but I find it's too good.
2)People say speaker. One in the bottom is loud and clear enough.
3) People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43"
Auto call recording and app lock not available on this phone.
Overall experience is good. Increase the battery capacity
"Sumsung m20 mobile is a nice and good.
Battery life is good I have saw the videos in YouTube 14 hours but battery is 50 use .
Totally mobile is good"
it would be cool if they had people make videos of themselves miming the song and make one big video  so EVERYONE can be in it.
I had the confusion  to buy either m30 or note 7 pro...but my college is full with redmi users so I decided to take the road less travelled...and now joke is that every redmi user is regretting  their decision....I had less expectations from m30 due to the hype..but it exceeded  them and performs really well...honestly I have played pubg for an hour with any lag or frame drops and was still left with enough battery...so there you go
"I like it

"The phone is excellent for everyday use and performance wise.

Highlights:-

1. The camera performance is mind blowing, you will be amazed with the camera shots and night mode. The pictures barely need any after edits if you want to directly post on Instagram.
2. Charging is super fast. No complains, phone is ready for use in half n hour.
3. Overall performance, RAM management, storage speeds, oxygen OS, 90hz display is as usual very good. Refresh rate is definitely noticeable to me but it depends on person to person.

Some negatives:-

1. The slightly disappointing thing is the battery performance which is just average. It has improved quite a lot after recent updates but not extraordinary.
2. The display is awesome but it might appear too bright sometimes, need some sort of feature to lower the glare sometimes.
3. Fingerprint reader is fast but not the best finger detection.
4. A major problem for one who has small hands is that the phone is very tall. It is very hard to type, I have had the toughest experience to type on this phone."

Cons : Too big ( a 6 inch size would be the best), finger print sensor is a little slower and take a second or so to work"

"I can say it's totally awesome. Didn't expect such type of product. The overall product quality was excellent. Coming to its battery , it's the best. With the 18W fast charger I could charge about 4 to 6percent per minute. I was a bit disappointed with the front camera , but anyways it's ok. The fingerprint reader and the face recognition is unlocking the phone with the speed of light. Another thing with which I got disappointed was it's thickness , it's a bit thicker than some of  the previous model vivo mobiles but it cannot be an issue . Its performance is awesome , I can easily open 5 -6 apps at a time and easily shift between the apps."
"Never been in - but I get pizza delivered from them now and then. I am a New Yorker and to call me a pizza snob probably doesn't go far enough.

Yo! Tony! You make a good pizza."

"Cons
1. Phone's upper 10% portion (from where we touch our ear) is heating up even after 2 minutes call and pain is happening in ear. this is harmful for human body
2. Basic functionality calling is not working properly so it's wastage of time and money both
3. it is better to buy other Chinese company phone rather than trusting on SAMSUNG Brand, Samsung is launching waste product to decrease it's rapo
4.  Fast charging is also not working, full charging is taking 3-3.5 hour.
5. Big mistake of samsung, samsung will lose its customer by providing this kind of product"

Amazon is not providing any guarantee to replace. Do not buy phones from Amazon. They do not care"

It had been years since either my mom or I had Filipino food. We both moved to Arkansas 20+ years ago but I recently moved to the valley. The first time I came across Hey Joe was last Spring when my mom was in town and we visited the Old Town Scottsdale Farmer's Market. Pancit? Lumpia? I was beyond excited when I saw the truck. Yes, I get excited about good food.

Everything was fabulous. I have since tried the breakfast dish which was absolutely delicious. 

Service is great, prices are wonderful. I will definitely be back."

"Samsung Galaxy M10S is one great smartphone for the price you pay. It offers really good performance in terms of speed, camera, fast charging battery and the screen display quality.  It will be a great choice if you looking for a reliable phone under or for 8000 Rupees from a very good brand like Samsung.  It's  really nice to see that Samsung is offering  features like AMOLED display, fast charger, fingerprint reader, package of awesome cameras that can capture some wonderful pictures both front and back and also a non-hybrid SIM card tray where you can insert two SIM cards plus a microSD card all at the same time for this price.

If you are an average or mid-range user, no doubts, you can definitely go for this smartphone for your everyday usage."
Battery charges very slow
"Camera Quality: 9/10 ( For a phone in this price range)
Usability: 10/10 (Buttery Smooth)

Biggest Plus point: gCam works on thitlike a charm.

Very satisfied with this.

The only drawback is the screen resolution if 720p

Other wise it's a great buy."

1.Excellent aesthetics.Great looks.

"The Goelet A.C. Beuf Community Center is located on 35th Ave. & Pinnacle Peak Road. This is an awesome community center with several ammenities including: classrooms, a gym/weightroom, indoor track, and dance/exercise room. 

The indoor track is free to walk and is air conditioned - bonus for those walkers who dread the summer heat.  Use of the gym is at a cost - I think around $60 for the year, so it's pretty inexpensive but the gym is pretty small.  

They offer a variety of fitness/dance classes, at a cost, including: aerobics, ballet, belly dance, kickboxing, pilates and yoga + many more.  They also offer specialty education classes including: oil painting, computers and spanish.  I have taken a few of the classes and they are pretty inexpensive and last for a few months at a time - either once or twice weekly. It seems that they offer a lot of classes and activities for kids and seniors as well. 

Other amenities include indoor basketball court, softball fields, soccer field, basketball and volleyball courts, playgrounds, and picnic areas.  

The center is always clean and the staff is incredibly helpful.  If in or close to the neighborhood this is a great community center to have access to."

"I am always on the prowl for a good burger so when I heard there was a new burger place in Tempe I knew I had to try it out.

The boyfriend and I went to Lobby's on a Friday night. It was not busy but the location doesn't really lend itself to busy. So we were able to walk right in and order. It's an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place. We both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share. I liked that the burgers were not pre-made frozen patties. They threw down two hunks of beef on the grill.

The burgers were tasty, a nice size - not too big, not too small - and the fixin's were fresh. So was the bun. 
The fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good.

The atmosphere was fine, good for a quick sit-down and the staff was friendly.

I hope they can survive in this location because they are worth a repeat visit for sure."

Fast Fingerprint scanner, A high grade camera with dedicated night mode and a good battery with at least 1 and a half day of battery juice on a single charge. Fast charging is a cherry on the top and fast charger is included in box. Overall a best phone you could buy under Rs.15k"

"Everything is fine and works perfectly.  Its stylish and the panel color is unique. However, the only flaw is that my fingerprint sensor won't work properly and it's pretty much annoying.

Sound quality is good. Only If you are on call and in commute and too much noise around you then you won't be able to hear what opposite person is saying.

Max 1 day if you use your phone with full day Data ON.
Battery drains very quickly if you play any Game or have Video calls or continuously on

"Simply put, this place rocks. CleanFreak has a TON of vacuums, a debugging station, and a fast, very efficient car wash. Best of all, for a mere $17 you can have UNLIMITED car washes. If you have windows, you have probably noticed that it is monsoon season, and monsoons hate clean cars as much as terrorists hate freedom. While I cannot explain why we call monsoons 'haboobs' I can tell you CleanFreak is a great place to wash your car.

CleanFreak has some perks I have never seen at other self car washes. For starters, the employees are outstanding. Somehow they are smiling and seem happy- even in the hot summer heat. They great you and explain how things work, and you get an armor all towel, to clean your interior. As you pull around and queue up for a wash, you are then given your choice of air freshener! Where else does that happen at this price?

I highly recommend checking out the unlimited wash VIP fast pass. There is actually a separate line for people with the fast pass, and how it works is a bar-code sticker is placed on your windshield, and you pull up to the fast pass line, and it scans your pass- and you're in- just like that. This 
saves time, and waiting in line, which is good stuff.

The one thing CleanFreak can do a bit better, is communicating how things are supposed to go. On my second visit, I was getting ready to start through the wash, and I asked an employee for an air freshener. He asked me where my receipt was, and I didn't know what he meant. I asked him what receipt and he told me that if you have a Fastpass, you need to bring the recipt that the machine spits out. I had no idea about that, and explained that to him, and he was cool I think it would save some headaches to either have some more signage, or give people a flyer with an overview of what/how to do things. Otherwise, CleanFreak will take care of you, and for the price of one wash somewhere else, you will have a month of unlimited washes.

Bring it on monsoons!"
It's amazing mobile phone☺️☺️

Pros:
It's built quality.
It's UI (highly customizable), you will love it.
It gives a premium look and you will feel good using your phone.
It's battery is GOD level.
Also it's battery optimisation is very good.
Display is just awesome, it gives a complete infinity look.
Cons:
The camera is good but I expected something more from it. I'll give 8/10 to it's camera.
There is no slo-mo option.
There is no shutter speed setting available in pro mode, this is very disappointing.
I hope Samsung will come up with some good camera features in it's software update."
Great mobile in vivo
"NOT GOOD, DO NOT BUY.  SPOILT WITHIN FEW DAYS."
oops i did it again...really shouldnt have.
Camera quality increase need .
It's battery backup is wonderful..battery can last for whole day and even till next day if used normally ...5000mah battery with triple camera....camera also provides better pictures ..overall I m satisfied with the product ..
" lol yeah  haha. yeah, things are okay, pretty much the same. slowly sorting out everything lol. exams are coming D: haha"
"I am using this product since 2 weeks but Battery life is very poor without gaming apps.
Camera quality is good not fine."
"Facing major problem , while watching movies & calls, suddenly some time's phone going to switch off automatically.  Don't buy this phone. In emergency situations this problem is going to be big issue."
"In this price range it's best mobile

My ratings (out of 5) are as below basis I used so far

Display - 5
Bettary - 5
Camera - 4 but nice in thi price
Finger touch - 5
Sensitivity - 5
Performance - 5

Overall must buy if you have 15k budget and I recommend to buy along with insurance"

"Outotec 's delivery covers the engineering , supply and construction of a circulating fluid bed calcination plant with a capacity of 1,600 tons of alumina per day ."
Very good phone in this range
"Loving this phone. With such great features. The charging port at the bottom is reversible Type-C and the SIM tray has a dedicated card slot. For a person who likes clicking pictures, 13 MP is amazing. It also supports Face Detection and high dynamic range(HDR) imaging. Also, you can effortlessly look through photographs and send messages on the 6.38 inches HD screen. Being battle ready with 4+64 GB memory and having 3X charging capability is what anyone would love to have. It is perfectly apt for consumers who prioritize battery backup above all else. There’s no denying that the Galaxy M30 is super comfortable to wield. Affordable, easy to access, and of one of the most trustworthy brand, Samsung Galaxy M30 is a must buy. If you’re looking for a phone with big battery and good camera, Galaxy M30 is worth considering. It is light weight with amazing display which can be expected from Samsung because it’s a brand which always has an additional feature to spice things up. This phone being available at just IMR 14,990 is surprising!"
It does it sometimes - it should come back ;) And the car thing sucks - I feel all anxious and yucky now
"Very loud, crowded and quite unpleasant. I felt very cramped and the environment was very uncomfortable."
Good product
"Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.
After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.
Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone."
"Went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it. I think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there.

The service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance?

Next up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal?

I ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. I've had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate?

I guess I just don't understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received. You're better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers."
This piece is very amazing and great.

i am writing this review after using this phone for almost 1 month and i can say this is best phone available in market right now. you will love camera quality. performance is very good. No heating issue. Fast charging is making life easy. i didn't try games as i don't play that on phone very frequently. overall i am happy with this product.
"My review after using Vivo U 10 ,
This is my first phone of Vivo brand let's see pros & Cons ,
Pros -
1.Display- HD + display , cool experience while using , vivid colors  so decent display with 720 resolution , watching videos better experience.
2.Build - Quality is good , feel bulky , back cover should have been of better quality ,
3.Battery- 5000MAH produce best screen time , video playback for almost 10 hrs ,
For normal usage 1 day can lasts.
18 w fast charge make it impressive.
Cons - Big issue is Camera ,
Why compromised quality been provided ,
It's unfortunate.
Even though received 3 system  updades but no change in quality of pictures, especially selfy camera is not as per expectation.
Verdict- Budget phone , decent phone in this price range , only hitch is camera , otherwise looking at price point ...u can go for it"
"Improved in all areas comparative to earlier models. Few concerns are in design where the camera space can be redesigned instead of pertruding and also the weight factor can be balanced better.
Other wise best android phone right now in the market."
"So far satisfied with my purchase. Device feels solid and well built, Battery backup and Fast charge is beyond expectation. Screen is best in the segment. Phone is ultra fast & it never lags or hangs.

Below are the pros & Cons according to my experience so far -

Pros-
-Really long long battery backup & Super effective fast charge.
-Best in the class Display.
-Solid Built Quality.
-Bloat free & responsive loaded operating system.
-Touchscreen & Fingerprint scanner are ultra fast responsive.
-Dolby Atmos Audio (But u need a really good headphone to experience it)
-Dual dedicated SIM tray with dedicated SD card slot.
-Quality of Cell Phone signal is exceptional.
-Lots of new amazing extra features like Gestures , Up side down call silent, Palm gesture for Screenshots and many more.....

Cons-

-No Slow-Mo Video.
-No Night Mode.
-No major software update & no more feature updates. Only security Patches.

Overall a great experience, Thank you Amazon for a fast delivery.
Im eagerly waiting for Updates for my phone & for the release of next generation of M30 as I'm planning to gift my wife & mom the same, on Diwali as they are amazed by the Looks & Features of my M30."
"good Finger print access - instant
camera is very good - can zoom pic to very minuter details
battery life is also more that 1 day"
"It used to hang sometimes , which irritates"
"Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years, and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good."
"Camera quality is not that good for 48mp
Mobile is heating while using normal apps and also on charging
Its a ok mobile
Not upto expectations created by the advertisers"
Phone is just fantastic but one problem in here.. does not work Google play or can't install or update any apps from Google play.. only just install from Samsung Galaxy app😓😓
"Ordered the famous ""Butter Burger"" medium rare. Forget lettuce, tomato, and pickle, eat this with cheese and maybe some ketchup to let that beef shine through. Delicious! Great diner atmosphere, got to sit at the counter.

Happy to see it was Niman Ranch beef, a sustainable/organic livestock provider."
Just love the phone.
"This place use to be a Wendy's for years since I lived down the street. Still, they made it look nice on the inside (they have a drive thru!) and they even had a man playing his versions of classic rock songs on guitar which was nice. The Hostess was also our server and she was super nice (Go Erin!). 
When a girlfriend of mine and I walked in we saw the specials for the day and when I saw avocado curry I was sold since I'm addicted to avocados. We got the lettce wraps which was good (wish it didn't come with iceburg though) and got it simply because it came with I believe their sweet and sour sauce AND the peanut sauce. LOVE peanut sauce.
From what I saw, they had a full bar. Beer selection was good, nothing on tap though which makes me a sad panda. I had to order the thai tea which was very good and tried the thai coffee, also good.
Avocoda curry was amazing! Though when I got the bill I was sad to see that it cost $18... I understand that when they say it's the special, it means that they don't serve it on their everyday menu.
I'll most def be back, very good place!
P.S. Came on a Monday night."

This is my review after 4 months of using Samsung M30 6gb. One of great phone Samsung had brought for budget users including all high end feature with good battery life.
Incoming call issue... Whenever i received call incoming call voice is blank... Outgoing is ok...i tried with another mobile the mobile is still calling but attended the call in redmi note 8 pro.. Very disappointed... Going to file a consumer complaint....
is starting to love twitter!!! Facebook-detox diet is working great
Battery life awesome
"Product is very bad after one month use its display suddenly off.
Fingerprint is slow
Camera quality is not good
Operation system is slow. While have 4 gb ram.."
"It is good phone at reasonable price. But On battery power, because of 6000mah expectations will be high. But have seen power draining out just the way lower capacity battery with same usage. Also the picture quality is poor when zooming out after taking... I am not sure if the reviews are just a public stunt or really those many people liked it. Thank you"
Good.camera quality poor
"It's a very good and worth for money, aswesome display and look, camera option and not comfortabl,camera will not focus automatically and potrat option will not word perfectly very difficult while taking pictures specially selfi button will not work some time.
Overall performance is good except camera and camera options"

"side & Bottom border area keyboard keys are not working properly, like p, q, capslock, backspace, '?123', navigation keys like back, home etc. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't, it's very irritating when you have to correct spelling by deleting the misspelt word due to miss of the letter. At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed
------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------
Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls."

Very good mobile

Very good product
"Best budget smart phone in this segment. For day today use this phone serves the purpose well.
Found issues with camera, applications lags and switching from back to front camera takes more than 15 to 20 seconds. This spoils the user experience. Not sure if this is just a issue in my mobile or it's a bug in all m30s devices."
Its a good product and I like it a lot. Even the prize is reasonable.
Good battery backup but not best as compared to m30s. Signal strength is excellent. Performance wise it is the beast especially while playing heavy games. Amoled display if there what have been fantastic.
Speaker of the phone not working after few months
" okay, thanks!"
I don`t think the coffee at work agreed with my tummy
"You can just blindly buy it. I liked camera very much. Battery backup in fantastic. I played pubG, call of duty straight 6 hours.. not even a slight lag, device also didnt heat up. All features are upto the expectations. Thanks Amazon and Mi."
Overall good.but battery life after updating miui11 something unexpected.

"Best mobile in this range...
Main Camera 13mp is not enough for this mobile. I had purchased 3 M series In this M series mobiles... One thing I have observed that it is not possible to block mobile data completely for certain apps. Only we can restrict background data... it is one of the main drawback that mobile data usage will become high.. In other company mobiles this feature is given... I don't know why samsung is not providing this feature"
Best phone

well to start with samsung m20 is the best budget phone by Samsung at this price range sometimes face problem while playing pubg but i have 3gb variant so i can understand it assault 9 and other games works fine on it.. so u should go with this option if u r looking for good budget phone by samsung at 10k

"Worst model of Samsung.
Some phones are coming with inbuilt touch screen issues.
Refund not possible.
Worst customer service by Amazon.
Tough replacement options are there but it's only for 10 days.
Service centers are providing worst service, they don't know how to repair this perticular handset.
Hanging problems will apear in few days.
Overheating is a day to day issue.
Wide angle camera doesn't meet expectations.
Battery backup is good."
Mobile hitting problem in 1hours use and battery life third class
The battery drains like water even in power saver mode. It heats up even in normal usage. I would recommend to buy another mobile with bigger battery. The camera is decent.
"Worst phone lots of issues with the screen.
Front camera very bad. Old Nokia phones had better camera."
Nice mobile
"Operating profit totaled EUR 5.5 mn , up from EUR -0.7 mn ."
"Phone looks wise good, after using 3months camera is ok type, touch is super slow, hangs if you install regular all apps, gaming super slow, music good , call voice is good.

Very bad product turned out to be Samsung Galaxy m30 6gb ram and 128 GB.Because its camera quality and or pie was not updated.Neither has the option of multi-window nor can you run Tasco together.
"If u come from a full HD+ screen u will instantly notice the pixels here..not the best display..below average i would say but due to amoled colour looks punchy...  From your very 1st call u will notice the lag..take 2 sec to show the caller id after it rings or vibrates same for outgoing calls..im afraid wht will happen after 6 months... but normal texting and browsing it runs fine..definitely not for gaming...fingerprint reader is decant fast..cameras are acceptable i would say for the price...battery life is above avergae not good but u can extend by enabling dark mode.. Comes with a fastcharges with usb c so don't have to worry about charging speed..takes around 1.5 hr to 2 hr for full charge...  really appreciate the type c in this price segment..decent speaker only get loud in max volume good 3.5mm output.. gets all the sensor but poor auto brightness calibration..
Final verdict- If ur budget is around 8k and u want a normal daily use phone only for texting, calling, browsing etc then go for this.. or add some extra money and get the redmi note 8 or in same price go for redmi 8.."

"It's been five months since I bought this phone and let me tell you the issues I've been facing.
1) The internet barely gets connected even though the signal is good.
2) I recharge data on only one of the SIM's and even set the data preference for that particular SIM, but the preference changes on its own and I end up losing balance from the other number as internet would be connected.
3) Calling on Skype sucks as the audio of the mike goes on mute by itself, only plugging the headphone jack out and putting it back in restores the audio.
4) The volume of the audio playing on the phone suddenly decreases and rebooting the phone restores it.
5) The audio starts playing from the mike at times, again only rebooting it solves the issue.

Please buy a Samsung or other phone because this phone is not worth it."

"This is one of our favorite pizza places - for the food, value, drinks and great atmosphere! I originally discovered them at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival, and am so happy I did!

It is in a great location, walking distance to a bunch of fun bars so it's a great place to start the night in Old Town. My husband and I's favorite thing on the menu is the margarita pizza. The crust is so crisp and perfect! As for drinks, Jac's has a really fun cocktail menu, and also a good wine selection. Our favorite: the ONEHOPE Cabernet Sauvignon. Affordable, smooth, and pretty cool that half of the profits are donated to charity.

Definitely check this place out, you'll love it!"

"One star would be giving it a holiday gift!

For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.

My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. 

The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved.
They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.
Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!

The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.

Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!

Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.
Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.  

I'm still waiting."

"Maybe closer to 3.5 but I am rounding up because I'm not opposed to being won over by ""smart"" bartenders -- when I ordered drinks she asked to see my ID and then followed it with, ""you look so young, you must get that often."" Granted, she looked younger than me, but I am not opposed to having my reviews swayed by cute bartenders who know the right buttons to push. In addition, the house margarita was good, and I have been known to throw bad margaritas all over the bar in a fit of rage when I don't get carded...fortunately my vanity was satisfied. 

The space is very nice and open, and despite the decent size crowd, it didn't feel crowded. Our wait was less than 20 minutes and there is ample place to sit and have a drink while you wait. Now, I must say, I don't know that the required staff uniform is unattractive, but it does seem like an impromptu tennis match could break out any moment. 

The braised short rib enchiladas were good and the fish tacos were even better. The tacos were slightly overstuffed and rather difficult to eat as a result, but the taste was good (3 shells, as opposed to 2, with the same amount of taco insides would be better). 

While the waitress didn't attempt to win me over with flattery, the service was prompt and attentive."

Good
"I like this product very much after experiencing this overall samsung m20 is worth buying it has a snappier Exynos, a higher-res display, a ton more battery, and a fingerprint sensor which give you superfast censor. It has also a excellent selfie camera"
Really good phone for this price! 👍
Charge sprrrrrr
Camera quality is average.. 48M CAMERA DONT HAVE ZOOM.. BATTERY CHARGES IN 2 hrs.. battery life is 8hrs regular use.for 12 hrs use need twice charging.. overall Okey.. not Gr8
"It is not for gaming, processor was not good.
Thin fon is good for general use like whatsapp facebook instagram camera etc."
Nice phone for samsung m10s
"Very pathetic, got dead in few hours it got delivered. Very Very Disappointed. I might got refurbished phone too."
"Not a great deal!
Extending the number of cameras don't impact quality. Pictures are not great ☹️"
Working fine
Double tap to wake up screen option not available in this redmi
"Mobile is awesome with awesome features.
The only drawback is the battery life as battery used to drain very fast while using mobile."
I have purchased this and after 1 month i am facing hanging issue so I personally suggest to all of you please dont  buy if you want smart services then only buy 6 GB ram phones
Camera not quality
"Overall
Its budget phone

But
Specifically camera quality is just ok u can say below average.... Although Rear camera is better than selfie camera.
I rated ✳️✳️✳️✳️"
Camera quality is the value of money Fingerprint reader is a average working
Selfies are beautified and there's a lag in the phone sometimes
Noce
Boyfriend is out with friends tonight. Don`t know what to do with my evening
very good
"Product box sheel is aal ready open
Product box is dif.
Phone not working properly"
"Fingerprint sensor is too slow
Some time it doesn't even unlock with fingerprint sensor and had to unlock it by pattern, and screen freezes frequently atleast 10 times a day, i can even return it because the problems started after 10 days of replacement warranty period"
Poor performance battery
All in all best phone
thanks!!! it was a ballroom dancing competition
"camera not good, rest are ok"
Guys please don't buy it selfie camara not good ... mobile no return available Amazon cheating me
Bettey life very small
"Battery like 9/10 as per battery capacity, back camera on average but selfie camera too bad, battery life good. I sold it to my neighbor. Return policy very strict."
"This product is really  awesome.
1. Camera quality is superb, I took all my holi pics from this and all are clear and really awesome.
2. Battery backup is great.
3. Phone's look is very sexy.
4. Overall phone is awesome."
"ok experience, just got to a point I did not want my membership anymore and it was complicated to stop it all. I just did not like the autopay committment."
It's very good Quality phone and it's battery is long lasting onscreen 9 hour  good
The phone started lagging just couple of month from purchase. I still have 220gb free and hardly using any ram daily as i have all the notifications off except for whatsapp and facebook. Still the phone fails to cope up with the minor usage that i do. Not a good experience.
In one word...In this price segment it is fabulous!👍👍👍
I just woke up. My teeth really hurt from my rubber bands

"RIP

I drive by here every day but looked over and saw the place dark inside and the signage ripped down. They never did quite recover from the roof collapse thing. Was the only Vietnamese place by my work, now sadly, there are none. They should have offered Banh Mi for lunch. Woulda-coulda-shoulda."
"We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldn't order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time we've given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good."

Fingerprint scanner is little bit slow.
Face detection also slow.
But in 16 k it is value for money."
http://twitpic.com/4qfl3 - haha^^ I love it
I like all specifications of this phone. But could be improved the back panel.
fresh prince and sleepy sleeps my nightly routine  gotta go to Dmv early tmrw
It's good product with great battery life but the mobile is made of plastic like material so it attracts fingerprints like crazy and if not cleaned regularly it looks very dirty plus the mobile does not have AppLock which can be prove inconvinece for your parents other than that it's great mobile.
Sooper.. awesome.. at this price range
"Excellent battery life, reasonably fast top ups.The handset supports USB Type-C and fast charging. The fast charger is bundled in the box.
Battery mileage is awesome. Nice 1080p videos (but look below).
An ultra wide camera is hard to find at this price along with
Dedicated microSD slot."

"Samsung M20 is a best smartphone. Its fingerprint reader, camera quality and battery life are good."
"Proximity sensor not working properly after update to pie. Possessing is slow after 10 months of usage. Screen takes longer time to wake up, even at the time of incoming call.
Don't buy this."
"@realDonaldTrump won debate despite hatchet job @megynkelly MK's unprofessional questions brought #GOPDebate quality down n 2 dirt,literally"
Very Poor Quality mobile
Everything about the phone is fine. It fulfills all my requirements nicely. Have been using it for more than 2 months and there is no problem. Battery is the best thing about it which Samsung phones were lacking in earlier. I have used redmi phone also. But I always ho back to Samsung because too many features in less price doesn't attract me. I prefer quality products.

"I liked its new feature like we can share wifi network through creating hotspot.
Night scene pic is very good. Bettery is enough for videos and infernet use during travel.
Has fast charging which is quite good.
App full screen mode is there to run specific apps in full screen by default.
Rear Camera is very awesome.
Face unlock feature is very good if your finger print could not unlock the phone.
Very responsive OS and apps."
scary cape guy
Worth for the money and good phone by Samsung. They could focus on the camera quality as sometimes it is not good with live photos.
" snitchsneeker photos were cool -but, dang, what`s up with all the comments about your chest hair - that`s just creepy"
"After using for 6 months, there are lot of software issues...while on call there are lot of glitches, and sudden call cuts, phone hangs, OMG, lot of technical issues...the screen doesn't respond...you need to re-start everytime when it happens..."

Outstanding phone ever
Best budget smartphone with 48 mp rear camera and stylish glass look
The quality of the camera is very very poor plz don't buy if u want good selfies... that's about the phone
"Camera is not up to mark...
As perbl specification it is 48 mega pixel but  clearity is to poor.
Mobile also got hang problem
Heating problem"
Best smartphone mostaly for PUBG. There is a up down volume bttn. They can be switch into fire shoot in pubg.. i have M30 from 4 months.. display is very very rare type.. fully hd graphics.
Worst battery life and Amozon replacement terms and conditions also worst. We need to wait to more than a week to resolve our issues. Worst experience I had with Amazon
"Nice phone with in 13k budget.
I have been using for a week and didn't find any lag so far
Battery is cool and wide range camera is also good.  Over all I liked it in 13k budget"
"1. Truely a mega monster in terms of battery backup , camera quality ( in terms of zooming it provides ) , samoled display.
2. Make sure that the product you get is free from defects . Proximity sensor of my m31 doesn't work perfectly .
3. Charging takes a lot of time (2.5 hrs for 0 to 100% ) as charger is of 15 w power.
4. I faced hanging problem which is faced by many others with other samsung smartphones.
Personally am not very happy with product due to hanging issue."
"The mobile running speed are awesome good product to samsung lovers for this prize.
But the finger print reader is just slow process so it can improve the future , the battery is very amazing performance. The camera quality is good also wide angle is very good. The graphics also good. It is very good budget range smartphone ."
"Value for the money , this current time
Camera is good but not better like
Realme It click neutral photos battery is good not higher level  , this gave 1days fully"
Fingerprint reader sensor is slow and camera quality picture is more worse than J5
"Very sleek and nice design.
battery performance is good,
selfie camera is excellent
Rear cam is good.
Quick response in Finger print censor.
Go for it."
Battery life is awesome and display is marvellous at this price range.Huge space 128 GB and dedicated sim slot and memory card is a plus point in M30 mobile.
Camera quality very poor.
Dubai!!! Still trying to settle down
Awesome phone....its neither heating nor the camera quality is compromised. Redmi stands out. Go for it👌
Good
Mobile was in good condition  but software and hardware problems is there mobile turnoff automatically and it's very slow I think they have dispatched problematic cell fone this is the first time experiance happen with amazone....
"It is very good phone in just 9,999 everything is excellent in it, it just needs a on screen fingerprint sensor."
"Looks like a beautiful day...and I am off work til Sunday, yay!! No bbq as yet though, gonna have to postpone my invitations"
"No headphones, no applied screen protector or in the box, only a mobile and a charger. Product is average. Hype>product. But A better buy"
"Already encountering problems with speaker. Voice breaks frequently at high volume. Even the software of Amazon said the speaker is OK, but it's not. Asked for replacement, but website doesn't allow it...I am stuck now. Regretting the purchase after waiting for two months for this device. Hope Mi produces good product rather than fighting price and gimmicks battles.

Added review after replacement....
I could replace the defective piece with new one which looks better.
Overall phone is good at this price."
Speed
Happy Star Wars day
"Nice triple camera setup, phone is very crispy, battery performance is good, sound is loud and clear because of Dolby Atmos, fully satisfied with the product"
"It's simply amazing and i loved it 😊. Some minor problems like fingerprint sensor won't work after taking my phone from the pocket. Another one is about camera, when we take some photos, the photo has less contrast and saturation in it.  so the object is not perfect while taking pictures. But the battery life of Samsung M30 is excellent 👍🏻."
"Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook, and it has made me very sad. Until now! The atmosphere is very modern. The color scheme is gray, orange, and black and boy do they stick to it, down to the orange frosted cupcakes. Impressive. I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter. I have only eaten here once, and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit, but this place is THAT good. So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home."
Good product
"I ordered M20 on 12 2.19, M20-4bg+64 variant, got the mobile on 13.2.19 itself. I prefer M20 only for 2 reasons. Samsung had a good brand name and it have 5000mah battery.
But, it not fulfilled my desires.
After, 3 days of usage am writing this review.
I am a normal mobile user, for me
Battery draining very fast. Think about heavy users. And for regular game players.
It's not a fast charging it takes more than 3 hrs for 0 to 100%.
Coming to RAM for 4 GB ram it's not worth. Repeatedly am facing strucking problem. While shifting to other app or tab. While gaming, typing the text, while gaming, while sliding the Facebook pages etc... I can't explain in text what I have facing here. It's not too fast for the 4gb ram. Before this I used motog3 only2gb ram its v.good performance compare to this M20.
Mobile weight also heavy, handling in single hand also difficult.
Coming to display it looks good, but it have full display upto edges in left and right sides. So we can't hold the mobile closely in left and right sides. We need to hold bottom of the mobile only. For the given weight thought to hold for a long period.
Camera Ok. Finally, Ram, battery, processor not good.
Yesterday 16.2.19 I report this problem to Amazon customer care, to return M20 mobile. But, they directed to do the hard reset. What am asking is why I need to hard reset for my new mobile .? If it had a problem , just take return it. That's ur policy mentioned also. But they are not responding properly. Think over these all. And buy it.
Most of the YouTube reviews about the Samsung M20 fails in my case."
great salads and burgers!
Battery and camera are not good
Why can`t I make a phone call! I hate this anxiety ****. Someone cure me
This phone stopped working just after 10days of using it. I roamed to service center 1 and half month and problem was not rectified. I pleased Samsung for refund or replacement. Finally getting refund.
 Product is not gud... Software isssue
"Okay, it's a nice place but I'm not sure I would drive out of my way to go here. I was in town on business staying nearby and thought I'd give them a try. The food was good, but not great. The shredded beef taco was typical and the shredded pork burrito tasted more like beef. The red chili sauce had an okay flavor but the heat level seemed to simply over power everything (and I like hot). The restaurant is very nice inside, very upscale. I guess if you wanted to spend alot for a Mexican dinner in a very nice setting this would be the place. Service was so so, maybe it was because I was a party of one. Whatever the reason, it wasn't a happening thing. Hey, at least the salsa was tasty."
"Good smartphone, but it gets heat up in long duration usage. Rest all features are good."
_J think so.. although think i am being ignored! not a good day
"Good food and able to manage a large group easily. Our party had 11 and there wasn't a long wait at all. Highlights: spinach and artichoke dip, onion rings, and tortilla soup. Total tab was only $160 for the whole group."
Good mobile under Rs10000
Kind of glad I didn't get to watch the #GOPDebate yesterday. Better for my mental health! 😊

"The phone is overall good. Battery life is better because of 720p display and amoled screen. Fingerprint reader is slow and many times inaccurate. Camera quality is good but the 48mp camera is not the best. And most importantly, it receives the slowest updates ever. It's past mid feb and the phone is still operating on Android 9 and there is no news for Android 10. The customer service of xiaomi is not at all good.
If you're in need of Android phone within a range of 15k and are okay with slow updates, then I will recommend you this."
Budget phone but little heavy...

"I took my 6-year-old son here for his first taste of frozen yogurt.  There is only one size of cup to choose from, and that is a little inconvenient.  You have to make sure you don't fill it to the top.  I had chocolate, and my son had a mix of cake batter, red velvet cake batter, and oreo.  They were all good.  In addition to those flavors, they had vanilla, tart, butterfinger, pomegranate, and a couple others I can't quite remember.  There were a lot of toppings to choose from.  Chocolate chip cookies, cut up moon pie, dark chocolate, white chocolate, and milk chocolate chips, karob chips, sugar free chocolate pieces, mochi, colored mochi, every crushed up candy bar you can imagine, lots of fruits, 4-5 different syrups, gummy bears, gummy worms, sour gummy twizzlers, gigantic marshmallows, and whipped cream.  There were many more things, but I can't quite remember them all.  It was the largest selection I've seen, but I'm pretty new to AZ and haven't had experience with that many frozen yogurt shops.  The employees were really helpful.  Everything was spotlessly clean, and the yogurt was really great.  We will be back."
"Looks and build:
Samsung M30 has a smooth rounded finish on all four corners and a back panel that’s made completely of plastic, has thrown in a two-tone gradient finish on the back panel.

 DISPLAY :
Galaxy M30 has a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels. The colours on Galaxy M30’s display appear full and rich.
Galaxy M30 shares its Exynos 7904 chipset and its really smooth.

CAMERA:
About the camera of the Samsung Galaxy M30, comes with a 13MP rear-facing camera with LED flash with a secondary 5MP secondary camera with f/2.2 aperture and also a 5MP ultra-wide angle camera with 123-degree wide-angle lens but low light photography really sucks i should say. If you use the Wide Angle Camera the resolution of the picture is really low (The size of the image). Forget about zoom in, its not even clear even before zooming in.

Performance and Software:

M30's Exynos 7904 processor with two ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and six Cortex A-53 cores clocked at 1.6GHz is the only thing in the gadget that lacks behind. Qualcomm Snapdragon processors are better performers. Well if you are a PUBG lover and want to play PUBG in it please consider another mobile as this mobile's performance wasn't good enough while playing it.

Strengths:

Display: 6.4” Super AMOLED FHD+ Infinity U
Battery: 5000mAh | 15W Charger
Ultra Wide Camera: 13MP/f1.9 primary camera, a 5MP/f2.2 depth sensor and a 5MP ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123 degree field of view

Fast Charge
USB Type C

Weakness:

Gaming Performance

Not Water & Dust Resistant

Opportunities:

Improved Processor: The phone runs with Exynos 7904 which is already used in Galaxy M20. Doesn't feel like buying an upgraded phone.
Colors: Comes with only two colors. Gradation Blue and Gradation Black. Should have offered with more color options
Gorilla Glass

Threats:

Build Quality – Plastic: The phone has a plastic finish and doesn't look like a premium quality product

This is the best phone in this budget"
"RT @EvanJKessler: I can't believe they went with the question ""any of you guys talk to god lately?"" #GOPDebate"
Ok
Pathetic.. I was forced 2 download a security patch(repeated reminders). post that camera is not working.. even I tried factory reset(3 times) as suggested by tech support.. I wrote 2 email to CEO Desk.. got 1 consoling call.. I was a hard core SAMSUNG fan.. this was my 4th phone..+ I bought 6 more for my family members.. would request all of you not to buy this phone..
" girl, when you crash, it may last for 2 days"
"After 15 days of use my finger print sensor not working shows ""there is dusty or clean ""even I cleared but same ."
Good for business use.
"Only 3 days i have use and cencer problme i get...whats wrong it.

Tell me what can i do...

Visit custmore care and toll me 3 days for repairing...parts not availeble.."
"Superb Mid Range Creation By Samsung.

Ringing sound not good some time speaker vibrateing
Gameing performance is decresed after the updates according to me device get heated while playing pubg and lag was there
Best phone at this price
Very good
"A compromise phone.
What's good is really good - the size, the cameras and the software.
What's bad is really bad - the screen, the fingerprint reader, the overall speed
Hangs once in a while, fingerprint reader doesn't read 90% of the time"
Bad product otg not support
"Eating Which Wich, yumm! Dont think I`ve had it since the season ended"
"Mi a3 is really compact, feels and looks very premium, back of the phone is really beautiful! bezels are kind of thick as compared to other ""fullscreen display"" phones but it's okay. This phone's really good except for the in-display fingerprint scanner (which honestly is the worst biometric recognition thingy I've ever seen in my entire life) and 720p display which is pretty decent but isn't sharp at all (and if you look really closely you could see individual pixel). Look past these few demerits, this phone's a budget gem with clean, bloatfree pure Android experience, really good cameras(the 48mp camera takes 12mp photos in normal mode and the photos are pretty good thanks to the imx586 lens which I guess is the flagship lens), good battery life(lasts me about 2 days of normal usage), smooth internet surfing and stuff. I don't have any practical use of the phone's speaker except for alarm, and it leads me to the fact that this phone's speaker is one of the best speakers I've had in any of my phones. Overall it's a pretty good phone for 13k inr."
Trump is such an ass #GOPDebates
Excellent Phone in this range. Quality of Mobile is superb in terms of Camera Result.
Frequent call drops for both incoming and outgoing. Samsung service center at Chennai blaming service provider BSNL and refused to register a complaint. I never faced this problem with any of my earlier phones with BSNL.
Nice product
"Purchased it in December 2019. Very happy with it. A major upgrade from my previous phone, the OnePlus 3T. The camera quality is really great. I was particularly impressed with the night mode photography. Wanted a good phone camera to record my little one. A DSLR is not always handy when one wants to immediately click a snap.
Purchased it for 35k with HDFC debit card cashback."

Battery worst than 2000 mah capacity phone.
it take ages for phone to charge and it drains out very fast. Doesnt even survive for a day
I am nt even a heavy user still battery sucks.
My purpose of buying was battery and its nt fullfilled.very dissappointed.
Amazon is nt helpfull, samsjng isnt either
i am stuck with this phone now.
spent 18k fkr no reason.
Rsally dissponted."
One of the best device in this price range I really like it smooth working and good performance. recommend for gamers in this budget segment
It's not at all worthy to buy this product in this price and its very waste
"Although the phone is good, but screen got broke frm only 3 feet height in just one month.
Gorilla screen is highly recommended."
Better
Battery is extremely good. Camera quality could have been better considering the Samsung standards.
Camera need to improve😊😊😊
Fingerprint sensor very weak display not bsd
@realDonaldTrump maybe see if you can get @SarahPalinUSA to be your VP so you can lock down the women vote #GOPdebate #idiot
Satisfied with this phone. Note 8 is very amazing phone. Camera is very good and processor is very fast

Awesome  camera  quality  ..and battery  life is very  ...cool ..I love this screen
Build quality is better and battery backup does great job. Camera outputs are not as expected. little disappointment with it.
One of the best mobile of the year and smooth handling hardware

BEST phone in 7000
"I have been to this place a couple of times and so far each time has been a great experience for the most part.  The food is awesome, and the atmosphere is fun and friendly (definitely family oriented, with a lot of outdoor seating).

Out of the two times that I have been here, I have tried their fontina burger, the pesto chicken sandwich, the sweet potato fries, and the garlic fries. The burger was delicious, the chicken in the pesto chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection, and the fries were awesome (although, the garlic fries had too much garlic for my taste). 

The only downside is that this place is always packed  (or at least the two times that I have been here).  It was featured on the Food Network, so I kind of knew that it was a popular place. But the funny thing is that I thought if going at a later time for lunch and on a weekday that it wouldn't be bad, but I was wrong and the line was still out the door.  Also, I kind of wanted to try their milkshakes, but the line was way too long to get back into (sort of wish they had an express line for desserts). 

Oh, and check out their restroom for a weird/funny surprise."
Good budget phone. Purchased for 7k during offer period. Overall very nice product in this price range. Definitely go for it if looking for a phone under 9k.
"Omg!! Only phone and unboxing that impressed me ever
Loved it. I was so excited to unbox it.
Amazing camera, played COD and it goes flawless"
"Back camera is ok..front camera not so good.looks to much brightness.. battery drain very fast due to its  moled display. Network  coverage capacity less comparable to any other brand like realme, vivo,oppo."
It is a good phone
Value for money phone
Not satisfied with smoothness . I feel something hanging issue
"I bought this mobile on 7th June. After one month display gone. Initially one small DOT came in display after it was spread over the display, When I checked in service center, They told It will not comes under warranty, It is comes under physical damage. But my phone does not have any single physical crack. It is internal damage. I fight with customer service. But they don't accept my query. I have spend 4508 Rs for screen replacement. The mobile not up to the quality mark. Without physical damage how the internal damage will come. Even it is an internal damage company should take the responsibility. How ever my money has gone, with out any damage. Please think twice before you buy this galaxy mobiles."
Battery Life not good
"Ordered this item with excitement in flash sale. The only positive feature is good battery. Signal reception quality is worst. Calls get dropped intermittently and unable to use gprs-net to full  extent due to poor quality signal reception. Service center people worked on it. But, it's of no use. Got frustated with this phone. Thanking of to dispose this phone in just 35 days of use. It seems that Samsung is losing quality consciousness while launching new item or at least when the issue is brought to their customer care team."
best mobile in this price range after 4 month use best phone in all available phone finger print very fast camera best battery life is amazing 2day
Average.i book purple but I got blue
Its too good
Morning  don`t ask me why I`m up so early
"I've been using this device for the past 2 months. I'm a heavy user, and M30 is my secondary device. But I do all my media consumption in this because of Dolby and L1 support. The device is too good, and thus is my first Samsung device I'm owning. The only downside I see in this device is the camera,but yeah I don't expect much from a sub15k device in terms of camera performance. Under good lighting conditions the photos are good enough for social media sharing. I don't play games so unfortunately I cannot comment on the gaming performance. Yeah on heavy usage I get 1.5 days battery life and if needed ultra power saving mode has saved my day couple of times as I missed to charged my phone on 2nd day."
The loss for the third quarter of 2007 was EUR 0.3 mn smaller than the loss of the second quarter of 2007 .
Good performance
"Oooooh, I liked it, very much so!  Just sad that I didn't get to try more of its myriad offerings, especially the pizza.  We enjoyed a lovely brunch here on a Friday.  Cute little place, lots of ambiance, good people watching (quite the hopping place on this midsummer day), tasty food.  We had a round of Bloody Marys, and those were nicely done, as well.  A great spot to just hang and nosh and chitchat with friends."
"Speed and processor is best ,

"Was visiting Phoenix and wanted to try some of the best place.  Tacos Atoyac kept coming up so I decided to give it a try without reading all the reviews (was recovering from the cold a week before so did not want to do much reading) . It should not be bad if the reviews are all 4 and 5 stars. 

Came here on 12/23 evening close to 7pm.  Parked the car right in front and seemed no one was in there. It turned out they were closing early that night.  The menu was small and don't offer much explanation (I guess they figure everyone knows what's taco and burro) 

Place was clean but smelled like smoke when we walked in. 

Looking at the price, I figure the taco was small and confirmed with the big, tall white tattoo guy behind the cashier, so I know how many to order.  My parents wanted fish tacos (they only know Rubio's fish tacos and burritos *roll eyes*) and I ordered some al pastor and asada tacos.  Since I am from LA, I am spoiled with cheap, good tacos.  The ones from Tacos Atoyas was only a okay compare to the ones in LA.   Usually the tacos I have are overflow with meat, but these are only half way filled.  Taste was a okay too.  

They also ran out of beef tamale that night which my dad wanted to try.

Anyway... 4 1/2 stars? I don't think so."

"Its a great smartphone in this range with great features.As always ,samsung is great with providing updates to its products. Loved it's battery life(huge 5000 mAh).Also kinda impressed with company's initiation with Type C charging port in this range. But it would be good if company brings update to the camera,which by the way is capturing noise in low light. Other than that I'm enjoying the phone at my fullest."
Battery & front camera is not good
"Guys fyi, Brightness  sensor  not working properly..So it's a headache...so please think once before burying."
Two things are wrong about product first one is that its battery is not working good as another piece of same category secondly its charge speed slow. I will be thankful if the product can be refunded.

"Very good smartphone from Samsung, I was previously using redmi phone because my earlier Samsung was having hanging issue. But my redmi didn't last for long, so I came back to Samsung. This phone is having low radiation level (SAR Value) compared to redmi and no hanging issue so far. Good camera and battery will last for almost 36 to 40 hours with continuous data on mode. Moreover a good budget phone below 10,000 rupess. I suggest this phone to people who are going for best phone below 10,000."
But in mobile net speed very slow
"1. Camera quality is very low, no matter which camera mode you are using, every picture is like clicked by 8MP camera

2. Mobile heating problem - while watching videos, while charging and at the time of the call

3. They don't have return policy, even if you raise request they will do some tests remotely and will tell you that this mobile don't have any issue"
Samsung Galaxy M20 over all good. Display and battery was good. sound is medium and camera is good. Can you buy the product for the cost. worth.
Very good product within affordable price
"Amazing display, good sound quality, Good fingerprint reader easily access,back and front camera are good when in day light. Back camera winder lens is good and usefull. Less camera settings are provided. Iso limited from 100 to 800.
Good battery life 5000 mah fully charged around 2 hours.
 Some features like network speed analyzer etc are missing.
Sometimes Lags and app crashes are noted.
Good design and shape. User friendly. Almost good phone in this price tag."

Without any doubt go for it. its a bit pricey compared to othe brands but its samsung. fingerprint is working well but it takes time if used temper glass.update(after 3months):- using fingerprint on this device has become a headache. some time it works and much of time it doesn't. the ui is laggy as always.

Even I am not able pull down the notification panel.
And when I requested return or replace the device Amazon told me device will be picked up on 25 Feb. Today it's a 26th evening there is no response from Amazon team. Everyday I am approaching customer service executive they are just showing me the sympathy."
Value for money. Battery life is definitely a big plus to go for this budget phone. Camera quality is really good with wide angle feature. Very pleased so far. Performance is good though I felt slight sluggishness few times.

But we can surely neglect becoz it has good camera combo with gorrila glass finish overall which is a rarely I see in smartphones now....

"For a budget phone this is an incredible catch. The screen resolution is AMOLED and therefore is no doubt amazing. With 6GB of RAM and 128GB internal storage powered by the octa core Exynos processor, this phone packs the punch. Samsung has entered the budget phone arena with a statement. The infinity display combined with the screen resolution makes it one of the best phones. RAM allows you to play around with multiple applications and gaming becomes even more easier with the combination of the Octa core processor.

One limitation which if taken care of would have made this phone even better is the speaker quality. Though the ATMOS system does provide incredible sound experience while using headphones, the speakers when allowed to prove themselves fail miserably. If you are giving a 6 inch display, please don't expect the users to limit themselves to watching & listening to videos only via headphones"

"I've always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.  I used to say, ""You know what would be the best theater?  AMC experience, with Harkins seats..""

Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.

Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.

Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.

Nice work AMC on making a great theater!!

Ohhh big big big heads up.  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   that's probably the draw back.  I'll still give you 5 stars."
Best phone in this price completely value for money. Everything is there what you require in a budget phone.

"Samsung galaxy M20 charcol black --slim&beautiful;elegant looking phone.Finger print reader very convenient and accurate.Considering the camera quality rear cameras with good quality,five star rating,.Front camera is not as expected,the quality is not satisfactory.In my humble opinion that is the only drawback for this phone.Very satisfactory battery life which is very useful  in traveling.Good storage capacity which is further expandable.Really worth for the price.One of the best medium range phone available and affordable for the common people."
VV good
"Battery life is gigh in number but lasting gor less time.
Camera quality expected more at 40k range but disappointed.
Fingerprint reader is not read correctly all the time."
" except the fact that it`s been raining since Wednesday, and not supposed to stop till Monday. ew."
"Best phone , it's quite remarkable how smooth and easy this phone operates, I've used it for now more than a month and still no lag , no performance issues , now I have become  use to of the gestures by oneplus. Be it the camera department , the smoothness , the speed and performance, of course the 90 hz display is a real thing and you know what , you will feel major difference when using other devices . A bit improvement is needed in battery department but OnePlus has covered it by giving fast charging which is blazing fast, however you can easily run this phone for one whole day if you are a moderate user , say 2-3 hrs of watching videos,  answering calls, taking photos,  etc. I am very satisfied with the product. Moreover I've purchased the 128 gb variant which at that time was of 38000, got 2000 instant discount and exchanged my old phone for 3250 and got it at no cost emi, so it was nice deal."
"All over good but , my mobile is properly not work and touch screen problem, so when I return or replace this item that is very poor and , because not  a available for return."

Apart from network issue, battery life & camera quality is good. Hope this feedback will help you."

They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy. Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines, fire places -oh my goodness. It was awesome! AND - the prices weren't that high compared to other spa's in the valley. Check it out if you can!"

With 64 gb its enough for an ordinary users. Previously i had Sony Xperia XA Ultra comparing with this phone camera quality is not so good but it will satisfy you needs.

Never purchase this phone. Simply waste of money. Hanging issue and many other issues. Amazon technician to check the issues was very rude and didn't accpted the issue even when it was reproduced in front of him.
It has 48MP camera bt it does not have that 48mp cameras quality.when u zoom pic u find it smooth and details are not upto the mark as i expected.otherwise it's  a great phone.
Nice product!
"Please don't buy this phone . It is very delicate. Screen is not of good quality. Once u drop it screen got shattered completely . This happened to me day after i bought it .

"Wow.

Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.  

I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn.... 

I know where I'm going tonight."

"A wonderful Phone which excels in every aspect be it hardware, software, connectivity, looks & others.

Battery is the only department where I am not extremely happy with this phone as it only lasts from a full charge to 10% from morning till evening. If I use it slightly more, I would need to charge it once during the office hours as well so as to have sufficient charge while travelling back to home. But all this is balanced by the Fast Warp Charging Feature pretty well."

I am not satisfy with the product. I am facing hanging issue (Touch is not working most of the time). To resolve that issue every time i have to press lock the screen and unlock the screen to get rid of this issue again and again.

"NEVER EVER BUY THIS PHONE.
 Camera quality is very poor even after having 48MP back/rear camera. If you zoom in the picture, it will start pixelating/poor image, along with image darkening. Such a poor camera. I have another phone from Asus with 13MP and the picture quality is too much better than Note 8.
You may consider Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1/M2 or Redmi Note 7pro, instead of this rubbish Note 8.
2nd thing, avoid Amazon, they DON'T have return policy. This have replacement policy"

They are one of the best pizza's in the tukee area, but if you are going to go to a place that charges the max for their pie ($85 for 4 pizzas) , i would suggest Florencia in this area.

This is a great boutique in North Scottsdale.  Ruby has such cute dresses to go out in and is a little jewel box inside of this shopping center.  As the two other reviews said they carry great brands like the established Tibi or even new brands.  One  that I saw and loved from Phoenix Fashion Week was Smoke & Mirrors Clothing from Los Angeles.  Ruby carries a lot of what I saw and loved on the runway.  Ruby is always getting new stuff in so it's a great place to check in with anytime you need a dress or a kick start to your newest fashion routine. Two thumbs up!

I had to take it to the service center. Though they were able to start it, I am still experiencing some issues like the phone hanging while use and unclarity and echos while on calls. Are these known issues with 1+7T handsets or probably I could have gotten a defective piece? Please can you help with getting these issues fixed or getting the handset replaced? I would be very grateful if you could help me with this?

Thanks,"

"Live very close to this theater so I go there whenever I can. Went to one of the grand opening movies ""Avengers"". The movie was great but when using the restrooms they are very small for the amount of people going there (5 stalls) there was no toilet paper, one was out of order, long waiting lines and one soap dispenser didn't work . Went to get popcorn and watched one of the wait staff take one cup, pour something into another cup then replace the used cup back with the unused ones. The seats in the theater do make you sore after about a hour. They don't rock back and the seats are starting to bow in from constant use so you feel like you are arching forward."

"Really great phone,smooth finish, at first I thought it would be a regular Samsung, was really impressed
when I actually got the phone in my hand, the display is top of the game specially to watch Netflix. The
picture quality feels different by which I mean it's better ,the camera is really clear as well although it
could do better ,the phone looks really smart and the battery life of the phone is awesome as well I
went on to watch 2 whole seasons of ""The Blacklist"" until my battery actually died ,charging is good fast
but could be faster ,the phone fits really well in the had which makes it easy to use talking in terms of
speed it's really really good and games on this phone is an absolute pleasure initially I thought the
sound would be low ,cause I've had a Samsung before and the overall output volume of the phone is in
general low but this was different infact that was the first thing I checked really impressed ,overall this
phone is totally worth it."

"I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment

I've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ years

I've lived all over the world

I always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA)
1.  Skim Milk
2.  Mexican food
3.  Tokyo Express

Now pay attention

If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should order

An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl
5 extra sides of spicy sauce
A small salad
2 extra sides of salad dressing

Ok, so I REALLY like sauce.  Really.

This place makes me want to cry I love it so much."

"After reading the other reviews, I thought perhaps I would weigh in - they seem to be all over the place.  The critics are correct that the decor seems dated.  To me, having grown up back east with this very sort of restaurant, it was charming.  The restaurant is particularly enjoyable to visit at night, when they turn on the lights in the garden.  

I enjoy the layout of the dining room, although I agree it is a 'cooler' experience to eat in the bar.  I guess some people could be offended that the staff sit down and eat in the bar when it is slow, but I'm not one of those people - I think it adds to the charm.  

I had a very late lunch yesterday - around 3 - thanks to an appointment that went on forever.  So we ended up heading to Riazzi's for a late dinner, around 8:30.  At that time of the evening, the dining room was closed., so we sat in the bar.

Their service is truly one of the strengths of this restaurant.  On this night, they were unusually attentive - even for them. The waters came out immediately upon sitting down, then they took your drink order - as it should be. Neither my iced tea or water ever got below half a glass.  This is something I occasionally find annoying at places where the staff draws a lot of attention to itself when they refill drinks - particularly when it interrupts the flow of conversation.  Not at Riazzi's - they are attentive but unobstrusive.  

Their bread is my favorite restaurant bread in the Valley - hands down. It is actually better than the Italian bread I grew up eating back east in Hartford, New York, Boston and Providence.  It's so good that I wish they had loaves available.  You have to possess a lot of discipline not to fill up on the bread.

The salad is as others have described it - traditional, but fresh.  

My favorite item on the menu is now listed under pizzas and described as a Spinach Pie.  This used to be listed under appetizers as the Grass Pie, but if you order a Grass Pie, they'll still know what you mean.  It is a cheeseless pizza with spinach and arrabiata sauce.  Confession:  I love all things arrabiata. But this combination here is perfect.  For about 1.50 (I can't recall the exact figure), they'll add mozzarella to it, but I've never done that because it is perfect as it.  

They bring you a healthy amount of tasty parmesan cheese, so you can always throw that on the Spinach Pie.

So, I had that. Outstanding as usual. My wife ordered the Penne Primavera, which was very good.  Last time I was there with my daughter, she had the penne with garlic and oil, which I thought was just superb.  Simple, but perfect for a garlic fan like me.  I have a feeling most folks skip over such an entree in favor of something more elaborate, but I recommend it.  

We didn't have an appetizer, and even though I wouldn't describe the portions as enormous, they were generous and neither of us could finish our entrees.

Is Riazzi's going to be sexy for the young, hip crowd?  Probably not, although it is romantic at night with their lights and sunken/elevated dining room, and has the 'cool' factor of the bar.  It totally hit my 'nostalgic for the east-coast Italian restaurant' needs.  

I just wish the service at most modestly-priced Valley eateries approached Riazzi's. You can get spoiled with the bread and service over here."

It's hangs in the initial days but after few updates its working fine.apart from cam and front finger print I don't think there is much upgrade. My one plus 6T is equally good. There should be significant upgrade from previous model's
Front camera of the phone makes a lot of noise while popping out. Despite several complaints i had to use the faulty handset
Good
This is an amazing phone with great features. Am really having a good time using the phone. It's a great choice. Highly recommended. Thanks Amazon for delivering the product on time. It feels like 6 sigma service.

"This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation."

"I will have to disagree with many of the previous writers here.  I have been to Michael Minna in San Francisco, which is way more famous and crowded but this one is better.  Let's begin with something that impressed me.  When my partner and I sat down, someone came over and immediately handed her a black cloth napkin.  Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them.  Second, the food was great.  The duck fries were really good (and free)... I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect. (I never eat those). My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce.  My dessert was beignets and creme brulee.  The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good.  (My gf makes it much better)...we each had two drinks, a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo.  All in all, the food was tasty and the appearance of the place was nice and swanky.  It's about time Scottsdale started opening restaurants that can compete with S.F. and NY."

too short as usual...  but was awesome
"First of all its sim tray was not opening. Requested replacement but any how managed to open the tray. The tray was found to be slightly bend on both sides between the sim slots which caused jamming. It was straightened and set right. Now working OK so replacement not required. Overall performance of mobile is very good. crisp pictures, good video quality, good screen resolution and very good battery life. Cons- it doesn't have a dedicated key for selfie or music control- pause, forward and backward. Sound and volume quality could have been made better but still good. Finger print / face recognition - not yet used so no comment."

"The phone at 90Hz display setting is a treat to use. Oxygen OS has a number of settings to customize the overall look and feel of the phone. The camera lens setup at the back is an on-off for most given the horizontal lineup inside a circular disc. A phone with 8GB RAM running at 90Hz display deserves more battery juice than the current 3800 mah although the warp charge does a fairly speedy job to charge the phone. Overall, a very good phone to watch videos at high definition, game at high resolution and click good pictures only let down by the relatively lower battery backup."
Fine
"The Lodge has been a pretty consistent happy hour spot for me over the last year and a half. Their food and drink specials are a great way to wrap up the week on a Friday night. I like their chicken strips and the cheese curds are great. The pretzels are also delicious. Service is typically pretty good, you'll be able to keep drinks coming and food comes out quickly. There's a lot of entertainment there, with corn hole and giant jenga outside, and some video games and a pool table inside. 

I don't love the Lodge as much for a prime time or late night spot...It gets a lot more expensive and a lot more crowded. Go for happy hour, order some cheese curds and a $3 Miller Lite and you're bound to have a good time. The decor is kinda fun, there are random acts of taxidermy inside and it's very, uh...Log cabin like.

A funny (but pretty well known) fact about this place is that Jared Allen (Minnesota Vikings) is a part owner of The Lodge, so from time to time you may run into him and some other NFLers there."

5 Screen to body ratio is not only acceptable whereas its perfect because u can enjoy any video and your daily apps with better screen size and space.
6 Dolby atmos gives u customization and total surround sound experience in ur regular headphones as well but if u have supported one then u cn get best sound experience.
7 widevine L1 certification gives u full Hd 1080p in prime video as well as netflix content access and seriously i am watching alot of series on netflix now a days in my galaxy m30 and its crystal clear with best contrast and colour quality.
8 The more u talk so u have camera because main sensor of 13 mp is perfect and can give u best shots in daylight as well as night shots with flash and 5 for depth sensing is in live focus gives u perfect edge detection. 5 mp wide angle has some lack of details but its acceptable in day condition and seriously it has acceptable camera and front camera has best in class because 16 mp in other brands will not provide u samsung like quality but its awsome and face unlock is very responsive even in dark place it works 200%.
8 finally its look and build quality is great because it has polycarbonate so its great and deservable because it feels like premium glass as all edges are round so u can use #Kapaver case cost of Rs. 599 on amazon because i m using this its very strong.
9. Exynos 7904 14nm technology will not disappoints u because its samsung's new mid range gen processor and it can handles every heavy thing in ur mobile and i am using this as my daily driver without a single lagg.

So ultimately u can buy this but switch for 6gb/128gb variant for future concern and in Rs17990 it has no match..
Do not go for negative reviews because everyone has something to say when any big brand launches things in their price brackets.

So choose with ur wise and experience the thing acc to heart."

Their is a speaker issue and volume is fluctuating

"I agree with Rachel C. & Luciana L. on the parking situation and the logistics of the whole place.  Although I will probably go again because my kids do enjoy it and I was able to get the last paid parking spot (at 11am).  I have been to this event and others in downtown Glendale and they can't handle the volume of people that go to these things.  Downtown Glendale is similar to downtown Scottsdale but 1/10th the size and capacity.  There are tons of little shops in a historic district with ONE parking garage and whats worse is you will pass many empty lots that they pay cops to stand around just to make sure you dont park there.  I finally ask a police officer where CAN we actually park.  Anyway, the event was cool with lots for the kids, it is a farmers market that sells food you would find at the fair thrown in with some chocolate vendors, jumpers and carnival type rides for the kids in separate areas that require separate tickets for each area (this was way annoying too).  Glendale could do better by putting up directories everywhere for people to know where they are, where bathrooms are, and they could spread things out and offer more space per human being (I am sure this place is stupid in the evening).  Plus they need to do something about parking, even if they build a HUGE garage and charge $20 a car at least there would be options for people who dont want to walk a mile before they walk around for miles....

All that said, we will probably go next year because we still do not know the definition of insanity."
This is a pathetic phone first they said they will take it return if there are problems now they are saying return window is closed. Very bad product hangs everytime.  Doesn't work at all.  I want to return this item
"It's configuration is the best. But lacking advanced features like screen recording, app lock, folder hide, TV / DTH remote and many more.

It only offers a good configuration but the user has to get it equipped according to need. The company seems to show no more interest to provide additional features.  On the contrary other brands provide considerable configuration and they are equipped with many features."
I was Ordered oneplus 7 pro but received oneplus 7. Very disappointed.
Value For Money
Amazing phone overall. Battery lasts for an entire day with heavy usage. It only needs to be charged once in a day for heavy usage or once in 2 days for average usage. The cameras are way better than expected. The display is vibrant. Great pricing too. I found it to be the best among all phones of this range and even ones that are slightly more expensive.
"1-Screen is too small when compared to other MI phones.
2-Camera is fine.
3-Battery life is also fine..  It's draining out in 7-8hrs
4-Rest the phone is good.

If anyone is looking for performance wise then I would suggest not to buy this phone because of screen being very small."
"Totally waste of money.... Oppo, honor, and many more companies gives much more in this price segment.

1 camera quality is too bad( front or rear both)
2 Display is also bad.... TFT in 2019 haha
3. Touch response is not good
4.finger print sensor is also slow
5.face unlock feature is average
6.gives look soo cheap"

"Purchased this mobile on 27th Oct. Performance is very good in all aspect. Call quality, camera, and battery are super. Previously I was using MI mobile. But this is far better even though it is nit a high end phone. Hereafter I will use only Samsung mobiles. Thanks to Amazon for introducing this mobile and fast delivery."

The worst charging ever this phone has. I sometime feel I can press my clothes with the heat from this . Damn it's so slippery you will feel it's possed sometimes . The battery life is max for a Day . I don't know what is the strategy to bringout such low cost defctive phones with new one releasing every fortnight .

"Really happy after purchasing this ....great display......sometimes lagging for few applications....but overall  good phone to purchase for basic under 10000 rs customers....as my point of veiw........
1. great display  in this price  range.
2. Big ,famous and faithful brand like Samsung.
3. lowest price with such features.
4. Good  fingerprint response.
5. Good camera for genral purpose ..Not very great..not for professionals.
6.Slim phone with good design.
7.Good 4000mh battery with type-c charging  cable...with fast charging...sufficient  for 1.5 day......
Overall  I satisfied  this phone  at this price of 8000 rs ."
"Andrea is absolutely wonderful. She's pet-sit for me several times over the past several years and I've never had a single issue. On her first visit she stopped by to meet the animals and go over details with me. Now I just call her to let her know the days I'll be away and she arrives without any problems. 

She's very responsible and trustworthy - her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution. She even came by on a day she didn't have to in order to get it fixed - all of this while I was gone.  On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals. 

I highly recommend Andrea as a professional house-sitter. She can't be beat."

Really good breakfast selection, decent prices, and a very friendly staff. Im pretty sure we were the youngest people in the restaurant, but I dont care. Their food is GOOD.

My husband enjoyed a Belgiun waffle, bacon, and eggs while I had the morning mashup...i think thats what it was called. It was basically a denver omelet w/ bacon mashed together w/ hash browns. While it didnt look ""pretty"", it was delicious.

The downside:

The place is usually wicked hot inside.  I dunno if they are trying to save a couple bucks and not run the A/C but those ovens make it warm!  Just grab your slices and go sit outside in the foodcourt area instead."

"When cowboys ride off into the sunset, they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer. This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive! You'll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon. Say hello to the mule on your way in. Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing. 

Inside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals. For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits. The night we went it was the bartender's birthday, and the regulars were definitely having a good time.  

Both a historic landmark (120+-year old original stagecoach stop) and a dive bar, Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona, and is a definite must see. I'll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two.."

The phone is better as compared to price. Camera clarity is good finger print is slow battary is good but the phone back is very bad plasic  quality . One of the disadvantage is no ear phone is give by samsung
Great deal 👍

"At first I was happy to find a dry cleaning shop that was on my route to/from work and had good prices.  The whole pay in advance thing and only accepting cash or debit card (with a 50 cent charge for debit) was a litte inconvenient, but that was OK.  The first few batches of items I brought in came out great, but then the quality started to go downhill.  I finally gave up on this place when 3 separate batches of items I brought in came back wrinkled, like they were not pressed completely.  Even the simple items like pencil skirts looked like they hadn't been touched at all.  Huh?  A low price is not really a bargain if I have to iron everything again myself once I get home.  Thanks but no thanks!"

"Samsung is trying to push its boundaries with the whole new M series and A series phones .

Its been a month now since i purchased it , i must say the battery performance is on PAR .
The camera quality is average  and the speakers are a bit teeny as well .
The display is the best hardware in the m20 ( not an led but the colors are vibrant ).

With the variant of 3 or 4 go ram you should be fine with day to day tasks but not heavy graphic usage ."

"Came here the other night in a party of 17.  Overall the experience was satisfying.  The waitresses were nice (yes, some had serious cleavage) and they were mostly on top of things - ordering the kids plates first, getting drinks/orders put in.

The drinks were huge - I had a margarita which was served in a wine carafe.  Unfortunately there was hardly any alcohol in it so I supplemented with a shot of silver tequila.  Probably could have used a couple more shots!

I had the baby back ribs.  The order was huge and I did my best.  The meat was tender and the sauce spicy.  Overall it exceeded my expectations (which weren't too high given what I've read here).  The plus was the entertainment value with people trying to ride the mechanical bull.  Only one person from our group did it - after 4 shots of Jack Daniels!

Overall a great place to go to if you're looking for a casual place with some eye candy, decent food, and side entertainment."

"My advice is go for M20, it's allrounder. I used M20 for 4Months before but now I use A30. Now I feel M20 is much better than A30, bcz M20 battery, 4G cellular signal strength, sound for incoming and outgoing calls, wide angle camera shots, video and audio quality for film watching, easy for Android Oreo with samsung experience 9.5 , and fast battery charging.
better to buy M20 Samsung 64GB model (black Color)."

As good as it gets for Chinese food in Surprise right now.
Since I changed over to this phone I  notice the internet is a bit slower compared to my old Micromax ( lower version) for the same SIM and same network operator.  I feel this is because of not very good data receivers provided in M-20 as compared to other lower models.

Just ok. Camera is very bad.
For normal use its a good mobile with good battery life but the anomaly in this mobile is that we cant take pictures with the help of finger print reader which is a big disadvantage of this mobile and even earphones are not provided with the set
Good phone. Sluggish when you want to do processor intensive tasks. Good enough for day to day use.
Best phone used till date
Fingerprint reader is quite  slow ....

I enjoyed my sandwich. The branding is a little intense. EVERYTHING, right down to the chips, is branded with the Jimmy John's logo. It's all good but it's a little crazy.

The sandwiches are big and the cookies they sell by the register are huge! Prices don't seem too bad either. A nice sandwich stop."

"Attention Please! This phone was purchased by me on 12th feb. and was supposed to be my Fathers birthday gift. the phone was defective and amazon COULD'NT provide solution for this issue. And what i dont understand is what if the product shows defect after 10th day???? Is amazon still not responsible?? i am a regular visitor of Amazon and i didnt expected this from Amazon. Because of all this even after my dad's birthday he is using his same old phone.

the phone starts lagging again and again. touch screen not working properly. Lags almost twice or thrice in a couple of hours. same problem even in safe mode. Samsung not taking responsibility because it was purchased from here. not ready to provide written mail on that too. Visiting service center doesn't guarantee any data loss. Backed up on SD card but demanding phone to be kept for indefinite period to diagnose (At the expense of his office hours). what should be done????

Thank you."

And on & off button takes too long to work sometime it just don't switch on

I am changing my star  M30 Star rating from 4 to 2 now
Its a King phone just for the battery backup  Super Super value for money but without 4G it sucks
 I want to have 3 more features in this phone
1. Gorilla Glass
2. Wireless charging
3. Water resistant

I don't mind paying 5000 extra

Samsung Upgrade it to 4G as I missed my return date , if have noticed before ,I would have returned it

"Nothing to be said bad, everything is best. Recvd phone within a day of booking from Amazon.Thanks.
Recvd phone on 24august. Saturday. The phone was not needed to be charged till Monday morning 10.30 am.
Battery life excellent. Display superb even it was Hd+, no matter.
Superb quality of camera and phone.
Overall superb android phone from My favourite Xiaomi... MI"
"I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.
Pros:
Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.
My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.
Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.

Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.
Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.
Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.

Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others."
Great phone for affordable price
overall performance is good.
Good Samsung phone m10s best
Very nice phone
The battery life is very good. Descent display.
"In this segment many good quality mobiles are available, its not so good."
"Galaxy M20 is a good choice, it is durable and gives a nice experience. But camera is so good and the charging is not 3X. It is 2X than normal charging. Otherwise it is a nice piece for the new generation. If the Camera quality is increased it can become one of the best at this price and thanks to SAMSUNG for it."
Nice

Good phone at this price
"Phone is decent but not enough these camera is ok .
Battery sucks and short cable of charge sucks more then that fingerprint indisplay is really bad almost every case it didn't recognize you .
Front camera is too bad lots of grains you have in image .
Honestly speaking go for higher version of Samsung or one plus.
I am disappointed with these although display is great"

" Phone is malfunctioning and defective. Goes for restart infinitely and takes more than 2 hours. Experienced it 4 times in one day. Disappointed with the product. Either replace or refund !!

Just spoke with an executive (I was called back from support team) and she wasn’t of much help .. issue critical and I am told technician would only visit on Friday (after 2 days of reporting the issue) to troubleshoot the problem, post which they will raise report and decide on the phone replacement !

Very disappointed and didn’t expect this kind of service from Amazon !!"
"Everything is good with this phone, UI is smooth I never faced any in day to day tasks, I wish we get One UI in the Update. Battery life is good but not as I expected to, its giving an average of 9-10 hrs of screen on time.
only disadvantage I can say is it takes almost 2hrs to completely charge the phone, its a very long time. charging cable length is too small, It can't even reach my table."
Value for Money
Excellent Flagship Phone. Worth for Money. Excellent battery life and Fast Charging support. Awesome display with 90Hz refresh rate. Camera clearity is too good. Dolby atoms gives you Theatre like feel. Go for it.....
very cute kitty
good camera but sometimes get lagging battery is very poor
"After using the phone for few months now, I will give it 3.5 stars.

Pro:
Good battery life for normal user.
Okay-ish charging speed.
Great looks.
UI looks cool too.
Wide angle camera photos are awesome. Even selfies and normal photos are good. Low light photography suffers a bit.
Face unlock feature is very fast and accurate too.

Cons
Fingerprint sensor is too slow.
Samsung's OS features like searching lags a bit.
Flash light is not so powerful and hence low light photographs are not good.

All and all good stylish phone. MI phones might be better than it in this range but for those who don't like to go for those companies (like me) this is a decent enough phone. You can get value for money."
Beautifully crafted phone with all the functionalities. I really like the battery backup and camera quality.  The back cover looks a bit old fashioned but still cool as most of people cover the phone. All together a good phone at this price range
Worst camera and video calling quality... Not expected from Samsung... Calls disconnected automatic many times... Call audio sound is low...  Disappointed
"It smells yum. Just your basic Italian deli/sandwich decor.

They offer sandwich, pasta, pizza, salads, buffalo wings, beer, wine, tea, pop..

They have cold cuts to take home,  pre made pasta salad, mozzarella etc.

I ordered ham and cheese sandwich. The dressing is very good, meats an cheese was good and so was the veggie. It doesn't beat my favorite sandwich from olean NY at tops grocery. But it's def going to be a spot I'll be at."
"Fingerprint reader was very quick.
Camera quality is ok
Battery is a monster"
I thought the hanging issue will not happen in this phone but I was wrong.It is hanging inspite of 4 GB RAM.I am regretting by purchasing this.camra quality is also poor 13 MP camra but other samsung phones ranging 20k+ have 8MP camra but that is better than this.
Best value smartphone under 10k. Ticks all boxes. Overall good package.
"Beautiful phone, fastest android processor, fast face unlock and in screen finger print sensor combined with lots of memory and storage.
This is a fantastic phone from OnePlus. It's fast and responsive. The touchscreen is a pleasure to use. The android interface is very well designed.

Always fan of OnePlus!!"
"Its takes around 3 hours to fully charge your device, I returned it due to this issue, Not worth, Fast charging option is not available"
Not recommending. It feels bulky and weight management is not good. UI is not like other Samsung devices.

Best phone
Face recognition is ok ok.. (7/10). Fingerprint reader is better in my opinion.. user interface is really clean and easy. But the best thing is the battery life (10/10). Lasts me almost 1 and half day without recharging. Display is ok ok.. (8/10).

Worst product
Good
Worst phone ever after 17 days the display of phone is damaged tried to contact Samsung service center but the numbers provided were all wrong. Being in warranty period they said that display will cost 6500. Lots of problem in this phone. Please dont buy tgis phone
Fingerprint is awesome
RT @Steve_Girschle: Wow Governor Huckabee was fantastic! #gopdebate #imwithhuck #th16 #fairtax
Camera quality is very low & worst
This phone is working superb and great features
"I went ahead with this product because it was associated with android one program and had a decent battery life. After 2 weeks of usage, this is the summary.

1. Great battery life:(8.5/10)
  I can easily get a day and a half to two days on this guy. I do a bit of gaming, YouTube, social media. Games run smooth, you don't have to worry about the SD 665. I bought the 18W charger( the charger in unit is 10W) and I wasn't satisfied. It takes 2 hours to full charge. It's acceptable because the battery is a massive 4000 mAh but I expected more from the charger.

2. Display:(7/10)
  Coming from a 1080p phone, I am not disappointed. WE REALLY CANT DISTINGUISH A 720p PANEL FROM A 1080p. If that's your deal-breaker, don't worry. Under normal conditions, the display is beautiful. A bit saturated, but you get used to it quickly. However, it's not the brightest panel and under the sun, it can get really dim. Also, in dark conditions, it is brighter. Another thing I noticed is that the auto brightness sensor is not great, it can get brighter than needed to be or dimmer.

3. Software:(9/10)
  Android one, need I say more? Android 9 is great, and I have got a couple of security updates, so far so good. Everything is very smooth and seamless, although android 10 hasn't dropped yet.

4. Camera:(8/10)
  It's a surprise! The normal lens, 2x lens can take some very good photos for this segment. The wide angle lens gives you options, but you can't expect good detail. The night mode is better than nothing, but that's all is there to say about it.

5. Gaming:(7.5/10)
  Games run good. No lag, no heating issues. Although, this phone isn't optimised for gaming.

5. Other stuff:(5/10)
  The auto brightness sensor is a bit of a let-down. The auto-rotate sucks. It gets pretty annoying while watching YouTube. Unlike other mi devices, this doesn't have the infrared sensor. I have mixed reactions about the speaker. It is loud, but gets blurry, so I always have to go down 2 points. The haptic feedback was a sweet surprise! Feels very good. The fingerprint sensor is slow, and misses a few. I thought it will be bearable, but it gets annoying coming from a physical fingerprint sensor. And face unlock is just a gimmick.

Overall, I am satisfied with the product but if you can push up your budget a little, there are lot of better options available. Or, if you could hang with your phone for some more time, do so. Or, if you don't really mind the software experience, you have better options available.
7/10 phone, a decent phone from Xiaomi."

".  Angel, daughter of the Lounge's owner Joy is a HOOT!!  I love her personality.  It's not a fancy place, little hole in the wall type place. They have been open for 8 years and have had a pretty steady following.  There is art on the walls (LOVE the Dizzie Gillespie painting... thinking of buying it) painted by a local artist.  Live music on Wednesdays/Fridays.  Wednesdays step classes (the Al B. look alike) and they have another separate dining-type area.  Wednesday nights they hold something called a conversation party.  Random 5 topics are chosen (we had a peek at last night's conversations) EX:  Are momma's boys a good or bad thing?   What makes a partner in a relationship think they need to start playing games?  What is most important to you in your professional career?

Apparently some of these discussions, as you can imagine - adding the alcohol ingredient - can get pretty heated.  It seemed to be a big group last night... 15-20 people.  

So after dinner, catfish, PORK CHOPS TO DIE FOR!! So tender, fried hot wings, mac 'n cheese, mashed potatoes, LOTS AND LOTS of hot sauce, we heard the band start warming up.   YES!!  GREAT music.  People walked in wearing their Sunday best and others walked in wearing jeans.  It's an everyone knows everyone's name type of place.  Older people and the younger started trickling in around 8PM.  

Definitely a fun experience.  Good times."

It became too slow within 1 year of usage. And my father's redmi phones works perfectly after 3 years without a glitch. And is discharged and recharged very frequently.
Value for money... Good product bt normal camera quality other then
"Nothing but good things to say about this phone. All things considered with the price of around 12000 INR, the phone is an absolute value for money.
The display despite being 720p is super crisp.
The camera performance is surprising.
The battery backup is more than sufficient.
My favorite thing about the device is the stock android which makes everything feel smooth and fast.

P.S.
- use a good quality screen protector since it interferes with the in- display fingerprint scanner.
- gcam mod will change your camera experience forever ( in a very good way)

If youre on a budget, go for this phone. You will not regret it."

Good budget phone
The phone got stopped working within 2 months
Fantastic superb quality phone
Fingerprint sensor is very bad. Not reading every time.  In this price it is not good.
"At first the contract envisaged the construction of three ferryboats with an option for two more units , further confirmed at a total value of 500 mln euro ( $ 645.8 mln ) ."
I'm very happy
"Look wise good. Slim and sleek. Photo quality is ok. Main issue touch performance not up to the mark. Touch suddenly not working, need to restart to work it(video available). Face recognition  is slow. Phone heating while charging. Samsung brand phone, but it not looks like the brand with these issues."
"Everything thing is good, but sometimes it hang while charging.
One thing I notice after 2 month on back side of phone glass I observed some minor scratches even I always use back cover.
they should improve quality of back glass.
It'll become Heavy if you use back cover and glass."
Omg! So good! So fresh! Great burger joint. Ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with grilled onions. The steak was tender and perfectly pink. Husband ordered the Original with fries. The burger was juicy and a good size. The fries were perfectly seasoned and fresh. We split a drink. Total bill was a bit over $14. Not a bad dinner price. Place was empty when we got here at 9:00 on a Saturday night but quickly filled up. Great service and great food. We will make The Habit a habit!
Awesome product so far
Good
"Just one hell of a updated OnePlus version.
Nice camera

Awesome gaming experience
❤️ 7T"
"Pros:
Best in class Camera
Best OS in android market
Best Display with flawless butter smoth 90hz display
Latest chipset Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ provide very high speed & smooth experience
30T Wrap Charger is the Best charger available in the mobile industry inside the box
Design is also very minimal & premium design Matt glass looks very classy
Battery last for the day if used normally
Gaming experience experience is superb

Cons:
but little flicker in the display that can be observed in the camera if you record your phone screen"
This is very nice to play pubg or free fire
Provides lag free performance but speakers started trembling while ringing or playing music within 2 weeks of buying.kindly consider that

Bad phone
"If you are looking for a good deal under 10k for a branded mobile and not any Chinese brand, would recommend to go for this product. Suitable for someone looking for mobile for general use; making calls, using WA and Apps etc. Battery back up is excellent with fast charging. Display is superb with super Amoled screen. Selfie camera is better than rear camera. No heating issues. Although not suitable for heavy games."

"Good product I like it.
But i don't feel it is 6000 mAh battery and it heats up fast"
Great Performance
Excellent👍👏😆
Very unhappy with the product as it was defected. This is the second time I'm facing the same moisture alert issue after fixing it from the service center already for free. Not even 2 months since I've bought it.
"This is an amazing entry level device from Samsung, M20 has an amazing screen, the performance is as par with other devices in this range the charging us fast which covers up for 5000 MAH battery life, camera could have better given that other phone in this range surely leads in the picture quality, overall a value for money phone."
This phone might have good configuration under 15K segment but when it comes to performance it is below average. I have been using M20 for about 1month now and there is so much of GHOST TOUCH and screen freeze issues. Most of the time it is very annoying to use and no return or refund available. Bought this phone as a gift for my friend and total waste of money. Most of M20 users are going through the same problem. DONT BUY!!!
"I'm torn with Cream. I've been to the usual clubs and lounges in Scottsdale enough to be sick of them, and Cream was something new. I like that Cream is emulating Vegas-style nightclubs, but it's obviously trying too hard.

The decor:

First of all, this place is PAINFULLY tiny. I've only been here once, and while it was half full, so it wasn't completely unbearable. But I can't imagine what it must be like when they have guest DJs and other performers in. A tiny place that's packed isn't popular. It's just... small.

The walls are covered in white (leather?), the tiles are white, everything is white - I get it, white like Cream? I appreciate the commitment to the color but the theme is waaay off. The hard surfaces make the place look cold and very hospital like - I would have liked to see more smooth lines and softness in the design, more flowy like cream.

The atmosphere:

The dig the loud music and the techno. I get so sick of hearing the same stupid songs on the radio. I love the change in scene. Phoenix/Scottsdale is so stale in terms of music. This is a nice change. But it's too loud when you can't even put an order in for your drink. I literally had to pull myself onto the bar (I'm tiny, 5'3"") so I could give my order directly into the bartender's ear.

They also had a really cool entertainment act - a girl hung from a hoop suspended from the ceiling wearing a white bikini. She was clearly talented in her hoop manipulating and was mesmerizing to watch, but like I said, this place is TINY, and there were several instances in which she was inches away from kicking people in the face. And THAT would have been worth the ridiculous cover I didn't pay (I try to find any way not to.)

The drinks: 

Overpriced and terrible. Maybe the bartender THOUGHT she heard me say I wanted a glass of vodka piss, because that's what it tasted like.

I doubt there will be any improvements made that will make me like Cream better, but here's hoping."

Amaajing telephone my son baught this nd he ij always in game nd playing nd in the phone all day is great phone
Everything in this mobile is excellent. But the charger quality is not good. The charger pin is not fitting properly and will not charge properly. I suggest company to provide a good quality charger.

"neighborhood research today, Day 1 of 5....and a little bit of shopping"
Mind blowing phone
Software problem &also hanging problem very bad product .don't take it .this is my advice.
Nice display
"Phone feel ok
very slow camera. takes 2 - 3 seconds to save a captured photo."
Failure
"Nice ...i purchased only ₹8,998 diwali offer"
Over all good. but there is some heating issues while charging and watching viseos
"Battery charges in quick time, but 5000 mah needs to do more than satisfying only,Camera is good, bright light controls options are really good n SAVE Power also, Dolby atmos for sound is too good. SAMSUNG is a trusted company with good genuine material used in electronic devices and EXCELLENT performers compared to oppo,vivo,redmi n realme. HTC was my 3g mobile but nowadays I believe in SAMSUNG again."
Item is good but when I purchased product that time price is high and suddenly after few days of purchase price is so down near 3500 Rs so that's was very worst experience..
Woo-hoo
Not as expected with specs which it has ☹️🙃
This is medium range mobile. Display is good.
Nice phone but finger print sensor is too bad
Excellent Mobile
"Bang for buck , got it at 8500 Inc Amazon cb of 500, fingerprint is damn slow, battery is good, previously owned redmi note 4, not much of an upgrade but the software is killer, flagship level features available, and in love with the display, great for watching movies, dolby atmos is dud :-("
"Amazing phone for an amazing price, fits the budget and does amazingly well. Has excellent build quality and great features, 5 stars for M30."
"Not satisfactory , phone hanging issue is there without even downloading any games , touch response is also very poor, opperatig phone is very slow response.
Not worth"

"Drinking + Arcade Games. This should be an obvious winner, right? Wrong.

Oh, how wrong. 

Eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food. 

Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event. 

Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until it's 45 minutes later, you're out of points, you're nowhere near drunk and you've already spent $40.

If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipe's."
"Camera quality not like 48 MP, FINGERPRINT not acuurate sensible after many times try it will unlock, battery life ok. And display tolerance not good it damaged in very soon, no protection guard, earphone and cover provided."
Good product.. Average in camera

"Part 2 of the business trip.  Dinner with the sales team.

We always have fun when out on the road and this was no exception. 

The need for sushi is somtimes primal.  This was one of those nights.  

Starting off with happy hour prices that were awesome we easily knocked down three bottles of Sake while deciding what treats to order.

We ordered a tableful of great sushi- alot of variety and had a great time.  The one disappointment was that the sushi just didn't have enough spice.  Not nearly enough heat.  The staff was excellent and very helpful.  

I would recommend Ra.  The atmosphere alone- great music and fun staff is a good reason to go."
"A great place for group celebrations, Fajitas serves up its signature dish in 1/2 pound increments, including chicken, beef, pork, shrimp and vegetarian. Served with sides-- lettuce, salsa, cheese, pico, etc-- and warm tortillas, the fajitas always taste great. There's little reason to stray elsewhere on the menu, other than appetizers and additional sides."
"A phone with all good qualities like camera ,battery,HD display,light weight in this price for this brand worth buying."
Not good
I had a really good experience at this place.  Started with the chilled cilantro lime crab dip.  I wasn't sure about fried plantain dippers but they worked.  If you go here you have to get the Thai bbq baby back ribs.  They were awesome!  Next best thing I had was the mac & cheese and also the spinach & parsnip gratin - good stuff.  Ended with the guinness chocolate cake which was pretty good but next time I think I will go for the s'mores creme brulee.  All in all a good time and would recommend.
Fault in charging pin with in a month. Worst case ever seen.
Best quality mobile
"Superb mobile under 10k.
Just go for it."
"Good but not worth for such high cost
No 5G, wireless charging and camera quality is not as such it was claimed. IP rating not given ie. No waterproof."

"In One word speechless....

Awesome design wih glass back and steel bezzel.

Decent fluid display looks like everything live.

Amazing camera..No matter just 16MP,awesome photo.
I've seen best camera in night mode.

Full charge from o to full charge in just 50 mins. i use this phone on 90hrz screen and best result.

No need to Go for RoG phone or samsung..
If your budget is 40K.Go for it."
Worst phone always hanging and version is not compatible
"In 10k, i couldn't imagine,
What a mobile thank to MI
East or west mi is the best"
Love this beast of battery which comes well under my budget
"The fingerprint reader is slow and inaccurate at times. Camera performance is really good in regards of photo and video quality. Battery performance is also good. Display, although being HD 720p only, doesn't mean a bad one. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant."
Good  product
If I could only update my status in just one place....
OK product
Nice looking
"After sleeping in  the rest of the day was busy. however, I got to spend the last of it with my favorite babysittee (the kids are great!)."
"Bought as a gift for Mom and she loved it.
Amazon as always very prompt & secure delivery.
Phone review:
Inspite being a mid-ranger, the phone feels like a flagship one. Gorgeous design, the feel in hand, camera lenses, in-display fingerprint sensor, bloat free software, everythings premium.  On paper, the screen resolution is HD+, but being AMOLED it doesn't seems to matter much. The battery stays for around 2 days with regular usage.
In a nutshell, an incredible device at this price bracket (who loves stock android)."
"Worst phone camera is of no use and mobile heat very fast can't talk one hour due to heat, four camera is of no use, waste of money, I used note 7 bets phone in smart phone note 7s also"
"Phone configuration is good except battery backup,but some features probably the sensor not working within 1.5 months"
Worth to buy
"Light and crispy, but I wish the implementàion
could have been done better! Avoiding some major error like inability to copy file from SD to home screen. I am sure it will be fixed in future microcode update without which selling this mobile will be a hard task. I hope some one is listening!"

I'm satisfied with display quality, battery backup of more than 2 days with regular usage, One UI Update. It would be great, if they have camera 2 api full support for gcam installation."
One of the best mobile

"I like this phone , Nice Handset's this year."
I loved this place! Amazing food and service. The servings are just right and very flavorful. Would highly recommend this place if you want a nice quiet dinner.

I like the camera. Battery backup is average. Sound quality is pretty good. Network may let you struggling sometime. Overall average phone in this price range. Samsung needs to improve in this segment.
Finger print reader is quite slow.. battery absorbation is very quick...
"Writing this review after one month of use.
This phone is very slow. I'm using normal daily basis apps not any heavy usage but still this phone is very slow. Don't go for this phone. This phone lacks speed & display contrast of this phone is not good. so don't go for this phone & don't purchase it."
Sound quality is worst
Charger not working in a month
"Phone looks smart and good ,, but while I am watching You Tube videos or any videos If I get any call also I can heard ringtone which states that getting call but its not showing the call details and the screen was staying in the same screen ,, and even when I get any calls also getting struggles to receive the call.

and one day when I get call the ring tone was blurred,, which sates like the Speaker gone , but some way restarted the phone and worked good .
Camera was good and Phone working good."

"being that i'm fully vietnamese and my mom has made all types vietnamese dishes ever since i was a kid, i have quite the tastebuds for authentic vietnamese food. also, growing up in so cal there are a lot more restaurants to choose from. 

for arizona, this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town. i always get their pho ap chao....even the owner knows this when i step foot in the door. :) their pho is really great..the broth is good, the beef is good, the noodles are good. everything is like it should be. their spring rolls are pretty decent. what i really like is it doesn't pretend to be something it's not. it's a hole in the wall place, but most good and REAL vietnamese places are. the food is great and the service is quick."
Camera quality not good
Battery quality should not good. It will work hardly 12 hr on Fully charrged. Case quality should be good atleast orginal case by 1 plus product.
Good.
wow.???? ??????
"Too much bad product....
Device heat shortly....take too much time for 100% charging..finger print sensor fail many times.... my advice is do not purchase at any cost"
The battery is not too good. Though they claim that it has good battery but the real scenario is little bit different. Camera is average quality. Not good for low light conditions.
Good
Network issue.very bad network capturing quality.not working smooth.very bad experience with mi A2

That`s great! I will have to do the same as I was forced to miss it. I had to leave for work.

It's ok I would say in its price range you can't expect a lot
"Cheesy, beefy, greasy GREATNESS.  
 
The burgers are made as you watch..  Sit at the bar and watch the grill cook (who also is the server, bartender, and cashier)  grab a nice fat ball of ground and pound it out on the grill to make your one of a kind patty.  NEXT comes the wine onto the grill and the patty... which gives the place it's name.  Finish it off with a fat layers of veggis.

Pair this with some jalapeno bottle caps and a pint of draft, and your in BUSINESS!!!

Don't mind the dingy early 70s decor....it is character.

The only negative...you will be jogging for weeks to drop those calories...a very guilty pleasure."
Once again thank you for your good products bcoz already I buy samsung m30 on july 2019 that is good and now I buy  samsung m10s on Oct 2019 for my sister which is also good with in small budget with all the futures.

Now i can't able to return this mobile back to Amazon, If any one knows any other option to return the mobile back to amazon kindly guide me."
"I can surely tell you that this smartphone is one the best smart phone in 11k-13k price segment.
Only down side is that cameras are not the best one in this phone."
Best expect battery
Don’t buy this product. battery is not lasting even 1 day. when i ask samsung customer care they said you turn off mobile data and delete all apps then only you will get charge more than 1 day. No one will use phone without mobile data and deleting all apps. Face recognisation is very slow. when you phone very urgent to use face recognisation will not work. you have to use pattern.

"Vishwa Shah M30 - 4+64 It's really amazing,the phone looks great the features are up to the mark .it has got everything which someone would want in a phone, really loved it ...also the picture quality is way too good and the sound effect as well.
The phone is speedy and the battery lasts longer too.
It is also very easy to use and equally easy to carry and handle and looks pretty cool it has got every possible required features and I will highly recommend people to go for this amazingly great phone
Samsung has actually done a great job,thank you!!! Y'all wouldn't regret buying this phone and it is so affordable."
"1st biggest problem- FINGER PRINT SCANNER - my friend can open this phone by using his finger print with registering his fingerprint in this phone ...not even one time..more than 10 times he opened infornt of me...which is unexpected...we are using our finger print for all type of transaction....this type of security glith is not acceptable from oneplus(flagship killer).
2nd issue- 90HZ DISPLAY- not worth...display flickers sometime after changing to 90hz...in this 8 days more than 15 times i faced hanging/lagging  issue.

3rd issue- AUTO BRIGHTNESS  is not at all working properly.
4th issue- this type of CAMERA u can get in 15k phones.
5th issue- SCRREN GUARD- After paying 53k ,i didnt expect this type of screen guard...in 2 days,it came out.

PHONE IS SO BIG AND HEAVY....53K Iz too much for this type of family."
Battery life could've been better. But charging is amazing.

"All the feature like screen resolution, sound, picture etc are good. But, the thing is, when playing PUBG it is so lag that you will not able to point your enemy when using any type of sight. I think it's because of the processor or something went wrong to something or miss.
Even if your internet connection is good. Samsung, can you fix it please....

Sometime it makes me so angry that I want it to throw away. Any how, others are working well.

It's just not meant for playing PUBG.

Thank you.."
Superb quality
Is Charleston bound for the day
"Though this is an Android One Phone with an almost vanilla android, the RAM management for the device is disappointing. RAM usage is about 70% even without any apps running.
Secondly,the device has issues connecting to Wifi. Sometimes the it gets disconnected automatically. At other times, an error message “Wifi connected but no internet” is given.
This is apparently a common issue with Xiaomi phones and the only solution which worked so far has been to restart the phone.
Waiting for a fix to be provided for this issue."
I have buy this product and use some 8 to 10 days I have observed that it is hang at the time of calling and also some time at the time of calling the listener don't listen the sound and when we resatar the phon then listener listen clr sound it's not rang problem it's phone problem I have use this phon redme note 8  6GB/128GB model  but so don't bye this product if u don't believe then see the picture who send bye me with this review

"While in the area we wanted something for lunch but knew we'd be having dinner out that same evening. Not wanting to fill up too much we ordered an appetizer and entree to share. 
The lettuce wraps with shrimp were so good! Fresh and crispy veggies accompanied seasoned shrimp all wrapped in butter lettuce leaves. It was light and tasty. For our entree we ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi which came with a pineapple, red pepper and onion mixture over a bed of rice. The fish was a little overcooked but still tasted pretty good. Star for the water glass test!"
Very GOOD  product

2. No led for any notifications  like miss call or msg.

Fingerprint sensor is something  not working  properly.

Scroll down option is also not working something  properly.
Camera  is also average.

Not worth buying  in approx 13000.

Also a good phone at its price but it heats too much after the update may be it can be fix with next update

The food was decent.  My friend and I had the meatball sub and marinara chicken sub.  I know this is stereotyping but being served food my real Italians I expected more spice and flavor in the food.  The alcohol selection is small but has the essentials (beer and wine). I want to go back and check out the pizzas before I write this place off.
Worst camera quality. Poor display clarity...i am using s6 plus which is best....so i believed m20 will be good as a Samsung product....but i won't suggest to buy Samsung M20.

"Don't fall for the advertisements which I did, thinking that Samsung in trying hard to do good in this price segment with so many features at this price-point. Let's see the pros and cons and I shall leave the rest to you...

Pros: Now that I have started to write the plus points I find that this phone doesn't have anything exceptional to offer at this price point which other manufacturers like Huewi, Mi, Realme are not offering.  Full screen 6.3 inch with teardrop notch, Dual Camera, 5000mAh battery, fast charging with usb type-C, Low radiation are the plus points much touted by Samsung.

Cons:
1. Dual camera system is a complete joke. 13 MP primary camera is just average. 5 MP wide angle captures are grainy. Lowlight capabilities are minimal. Pro mode is another joke.
2. Phone heats up considerably when playing games like PUBG
3. For a 5000 mAh battery day to day performance is rather poor. Lasts only a day on more than average use, which other phones last with 3500mAh battery.
4. Fast charging is not fast at all, requires more than 2 hrs to charge fully.
5. Fingerprint sensor feels like still in its fast generation. Slow, inappropriate, problematic. Face unlock is another disappointment.

Well that's more or less it.. Decision is yours 🙂"

Damnation. I just woke up.
I liked this mobile. First time using OnePlus. This model 7T is nice. The only thing is incoming voice and outgoing voice during the call is low than Samsung.
"I am happy that I have Samung Galaxy M20. The most interesting thing on the Galaxy M20's spec sheet is its brand new Exynos 7904 processor.It has two high-performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores running at 1.8GHz and six power-efficient ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at 1.6GHz, plus a Mali-G71 GPU.

And the primary rear camera is a 13-megapixel unit with an f/1.9 aperture, while the secondary camera has a 5-megapixel sensor and 120 degree field of view. The front camera has an 8-megapixel resolution that provides excellent photos.

I didn't have any trouble using the Samsung Galaxy M20 for day-to-day tasks. Apps and light games ran without any trouble, and i multitasked quite heavily too.The screen is bright and crisp, with good viewing angles. Videos looked good and games including. Battery life in everyday use was extraordinarily good.

Video was also just about okay. Recording goes up to 1080p, and there's no stabilisation which is perhaps understandable at this price level. overall m20 is the best smartphone for middle class."
I like battery performance in this phone. Its really good ..but in fingerprint scanner..its little disappointed..front camera is really good..but in wide angle camera picture quality is pathetic..

"My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  

We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!

I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.  How disappointing."

"Finger print scanner of my phone was gone inside of the body when i used to place my finger to scan it use to go inside ,so ordered for replacement. The replacement product had also repeated the fault and fault was more than the previous product,the replacef m30s fingerprint scanner was gone more inside than earlier product . To explain it there was a gap between body and fingerprint scanner of m30s so unfortunately i have to return the product and asked for refund and currently the process is in progress."

"So had to choose between this phone and the rog2. Both are excellent phones and was a tough choice. Flipkart having less availability of rog2 made the choice easier in the end :) moreover, one plus is now a trusted brand name so that helps. Its pros - lighter, trustworthy brand, quicker charging speed, more professional look, better camera, macro lens!
Cons - 3800mah battery compared to 6k mah of rog2. Did not expect the phone's battery to really last more than 12 hours, which is fine since we all charge at night atleast, however to my surprise it's been lasting for more than a day!
Plus the warp charge is indeed as good as marketed, got around 75% in half hour from 1%.
The fingerprint reader and camera are very good, having no issues. The 90hz refresh rate is probably just a new marketing thing to attract better prices. Even an above average user won't notice it. Not sure what 1 has to do to even notice it lol. The screen quality is awesome indeed though.
Hope these details help."
"There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so it's best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dee's Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered.
In an emergency situation, you're better suited going to Mischa's Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezio's in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible."

"We had a very difficult time finding trail 201 which was noted as one of the more strenuous hikes. We took trail 100 and came across some extreme mountain bikers, several other hikers and a couple who gave us confusing directions on how to reach one of the highest sections of the mountain. We got lost and ended trail busting which is highly discouraged but give us rules and we will break  em. During our run back down the trail I took a pretty hard fall face planting into the dirt, stabbing my right hand into a rock and banging up my knee. No broken bones or teeth, thankfully. We had just passed a couple of hikers when I took the fall so they saw everything. I laid there for about 10 seconds, jumped back up, noticed the blood, my torn tee and just continued on with the hike. We came across a park ranger who was standing outside his truck and asked if he had any medical supplies. Unfortunately, his first aid kit was about 20 years old and didn't contain anything that would help any of my wounds. We found a CVS on our way home and picked up some medical supplies and my wounds were washed and bandaged in the parking lot. 

Probably my most memorable hike thus far."

A+ processor ( snapdragon 665)

Performance is very good

Only competition for this phone( my perception) is Samsung m series as it has only two major upgrades that is the their AMOLED display and the processor u10 has an advantage over this as it offers snapdragon which is slightly better than Samsung's exynos rest all specs are same
And yes Samsung UI is way better than Vivo's funtouch OS"

Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didn't sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I don't like it.

This Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but it's nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more ""quaint"" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance ""browsing""; this makes my girlfriend very angry.

I don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere else(Trader Joe's, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it. 

One last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty. You can get one of their ""surfboard"" pizzas which will feed 2 for 2-3 days with a couple of toppings with Daiya cheese for $15.99. This may be the best deal going at Whole Foods and make up for that $8 bar of dark chocolate you just bought."

All the features are good in the mobile. But it is having virus.  When ever I called to someone afterwards a popup dialogue comes with advertisements in the full screen. I don't know whether This issue is only faced by me or all Samsung m30s customer. But with this virus I can't rate even 3 star. I am fearing to use the mobile for online transactions because of virus. I am unable to remove the adware virus. Amazon kindly solve this issue.
Phone is superb..but the Amazon delivery lead time is too high after several follow-ups I have got the order..
Really great phone in this price range. Photo quality is great. I am giving this feedback after one month of use. Satisfied with the Samsung product. This M series of samsung will be tough fight for all other affordable price phones.
worst performance by Samsung using edge however buy this for secondary phone but the network is a biggest issue so many drop call and no GPS unable to replace trying to connect with the amazon team from last 2 weeks but no response.

"I have a Samsung M31
SYMPTOMS

a) all videos regardless of the application used are playing on fastforward with no sound. This happens on all apps incl youtube, netflix, amazon prime, including videos I have been sent via WhatsApp. b) there is no sound on the phone at all - nothing when I play music, it doesn't ring when someone calls me, and even though i can pick up the call, I can't hear the other person's voice and they cant hear mine

 ATTEMPTED FIXES THAT DID NOT WORK
1. Restart multiple times
2. Reset app preferences
3. Play with Dolby settings (restore to default, turn off/on)
4. Wipe cache preferences using volume up/down buttons then rebooting
5. Adjusting all the volume settings to make sure nothing was muted
6. Turn phone on on safe mode to ensure it wasnt the apps that were buggy (and played a video I had stored on my phone but same issue)"

"A power packed smart phone with a huge battery of 5000mAh which keeps the phone up for quite a considerable amount of tine but not for an entire day and two.  The battery life is decent but it could be programmed better to hold up longer than a day.
The phone on the other hand feels quite heavy. The camera quality is good but not as good as the other Samsung series. In a nutshell all the features required to make a smart phone stand out are present in the M20 but are definitely on a compromised level."
Phone gets heated around the camera with in couple of clicks and it also gets heats up while charging as well

Cons: Buggy software, too many notifications, auto rotate doesn't work sometimes.
Overall, no complaints, it's a very good phone and works well."

Happy that I got what I expected.
I am giving 4 star for now as I have to check if this phone has a heating issue or not and I will change it to 5 once I am satisfied.

"Lunch review:  
Great quick lunch options. I'm a big fan of the lunch salads.  They are very filling (paired with the free chips and salsa!!)  My favorite is the Chipotle Chicken Salad (Mixed lettuce, black beans, roasted corn, cheese mix, pico de gallo topped with grilled chicken)-- it's only $6.99.  The spunky chipotle dressing is delish.  There are also several lunch-sized versions of dinner plates available for diners looking for a heartier meal.  The service is always friendly and were are able to get in and out in less than an hour, which is very convenient during a busy work day."

Over all good 👍 PC at this price range
ahahaha! That`s funny.
Network quality is very very poor
"Worst camera.
Leave about 48MP, after looking at the pics(in mobile, not PC/laptop) you will feel like pictures were taken from some kind of 2MP or age-old 8MP camera. The battery is good but not up to the mark, for 6000mah you would expect it to last for minimum 2 days at least with basic usage(no movies/games/heavy browsing etc..) like calls and checking notifications, messaging, etc. It lasted for just 28 hours for me with basic usage. Charging time was around 3hrs.

Wifi coverage is also limited. It doesn't connect if I am in different room which was not the case with real me and One Plus phone.

The only best thing is the display. I think this mobile has got the best display under 15K range. If your only priority is display then nothing can beat this mobile under 15K.

And the worst part is that there is no replacement for this mobile, only refund. I believe replacement was not given considering the additional 1000 cashback which will be credited to the seller if they refund the amount, not sure though. Seller - STPL Exclusive Online."

"I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR."
Battery life not good
"I just bought this phone one week ago. So far experience is good, but in the starting level fingerprint reader has taken time to read but after use it's working good and facelock is awesome. Yes, there is no doubt picture quality is wow. I yet not sure about battery life because I'm not using mobile so much but I think 4030 mha battery would be better for this phone. If you want to purchase this I would suggest go for that."
"Loved display, economically good product. Face recognization is just little disappointing. But overall product compatibility was fine."

No complaints so far with butter smooth operation on Android 10 and oxygen OS. My usage is limited, I have been charging only once for a day and by changing the refresh rate to 60HZ  the charge on phone really stands out. The camera is good but could have been amazing.  Overall a amazing piece of product for this price."

"This mobile is superb. Overall configuration and c port charger nice. Feels like we have a very expensive mobile. But rear camera should be at least 16 mp or other wide angle should be 8 mp.. Like in 26, 5, 8 ratio. It would be more better but this is also nice."
"It's one of the best phone around this range . Doesn't have the camera quality like realme XT
Best for gaming Mediatech Helio processor just fantastic. Even though having a Liquid cooling system it have a bit heating issue but not overheating but compared to Pocco F1 it's a bit hot I'm a YouTube content creator. So i use all this phone. If having a bit more budget will suggest to go for Redmi K20 pro Realme X2. Or if looking for a gaming phone go for Asus Rog phone 2. Best tuung is that we are having a Hand free Alexa It's so nice that we can access Alexa by saying ""Alexa"" and Als use Google Assistant at the same time which is not available for any other phone of this range. The only Thing A back draw is its display and the water notch display. It's so tempting that it's just having a led IPS Display. By the way anything can't be perfect. Not that good as Pocco F1 if anyone using Pocco F1 better don't change it. Never go for phone saying 64 MP 108 MP etc because not just Megapixel which matter the picture quality. It has a great photo precision. If it found helpful please follow me and Click of the ""helpful""."

"Good lord.  I don't ask for much.  I ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee.  They didn't have to bake the quiche, just warm it up.  I waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he ""got lost.""  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was ""eh.""  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.  Fortunately, I was on my scooter, so I could squeeze into a non-parking space easily."

"Good so far, but battery life could have been better"
There is a small scratch on rear camera.
 Awesome...looks great. Selfie are beautiful and fast in gaming.. battery backup is too good. It's amazing phone. Everything is perfect...
Please do not buy this phone. I personally experienced hell out of problems with this phone. You will be scared by seeing and experienving the over heated battery within 10-15 mins of continuous usage. Battery is draining like hell. Its like eye masking theory towards customers by hyping the adds in amazon. One of the worst product I have booked through amaxon.
What the hell is wrong with the processor ? The phone hanged or got stuck 5 times in three days. Ridiculous phone. My one plus 5 works better
"Been using this beast for over a month... Definitely a monster in terms of performance. Camera quality is great and speakers are loud enough. Though found some bugs like notification panel stuck on the top and you have to lock the screen and unlock again and it happens hardly 1 out of 1000 times but received an update and I think it's fixed now..
Would definitely recommend this beast."
Nice phone.

"i stopped by here on a lunch break because the sign said appraisals by appointment. the owner (?) indra was there and willing to do the appraisal on my engagement ring while i waited (without an appointment ... yay!). he cleaned my ring at no charge, inspected it and provided the retail value at no charge. indra told me a written appraisal for insurance purposes is only $45 ... a bargain compared to what others in the valley are charging. the stock of jewelry was lovely ... a nice mix of new and used pieces. some very unique, one of a kind finds as well. i found a few things i would prefer not to live without! 

they do all their own importing, and buy, sell and trade jewelry. i felt he was very honest about my ring, the cash value he stated was in line with numbers i heard from other jewelers and he was charming and helpful, answering questions and educating me while i ogled over diamonds and pearls. i will return to have my watch batteries replaced, a pair of earrings changed from yellow to white gold, and pretty much anything else i can think of. i trusted him immediately, which, when dealing with diamonds, is of paramount importance to me."

"Sacks is a different kind of sandwich shop. They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)

If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. 

From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed. 

Oh, and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie. Brilliant."

"Had a late night plumbing emergency last night. Called a friend who recommended Kevin's Classic Plumbing. Within an hour the plumber was at my home repairing my problem. At 10:00pm my water was back on with kids taking showers, toilets being flushed, and my wife was talking to me again. Sounds great right? Get's even better! The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever. Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy. Kevin's Classic Plumbing will be my plumbing company for both home and work from now on.

On another note... I had called one of those companys that advertise on TV all day long. They were not able to come out last night and when they did call me they indicated that it was probably not something they could fix and would most likely require a two man crew. Thanks Parker & Son's."

The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance...

"I like the android one and the camera is comparatively good. Other than that this mobile lacks a good battery, don't have earphone jack, doesn't have expandable memory, the speaker was so loud and started loosing the sound quality within a week, the projected camera lens gets scratched easily and even though it's running Android Pie it doesn't have camera api2 support.

Update: it's touch screen is loosing it's sensitivity sometimes. The mobile freezes when no apps are even running. The camera app is having lot of bugs and the front flash is not working even after the 5th update I received. Very bad experience. Totally waste. I brought it for 14k and now it's 11k, not at all worth for both."

The overall experience is quite good. No issues with phone performance.
Design - good looking phone with a neat design.
Display - super AMOLED display is really good.
Camera - photos quality is average.
Battery - battery backup is poor.
Storage - Internal storage is enough for a normal user.
Sound - speaker sound quality is average."

"I have to replace my current Pixel phone as it had become too sluggish. I loved Pixel's camera and was planning to buy Pixel 4 but alas it didn't launch in India. So I wanted to check for other phones and decided to reduce the budget of the phone. I wanted a decent camera, UI close to stock android and a good camera. I have used OnePlus2 before so I decided to go for the latest OnePlus 7t and its a fabulous Phone for this price range.

PROS
- Awesome camera (not pixel but very good)
- The battery lasts longer and warp charge is super fast
- The display is very good
- Build is nice

CONS
- Not a big fan of the camera bump and setup but it's subjective (maybe someone may like it)
- The display is not end-to-end like 7Pro and 7T Pro but not enough. 7t pro is definitely looking gorgeous but almost 14k more expensive.

Also got it in Diwali offer so the deal was good."
mum just made me cry coz she said something so sweet to me  i love her so much! MUMS ARE THE BEST!
"Very bad product. There are so many issue.
1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.
2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.
3. Sound is also not good.
4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.
Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone. Samsung  are fooling the amezon customer.
Don't buy."

"There is nothing positive to write about the phone except the camera. Battery drains so quickly. I was using Nokia 8.1 before, its battery lasted sometime for 2 days, Nothing changed and with 1+7t, battery drains within half a day. Couple of updates have already happened but no change. Response is average. Overall bad decision but after spending so much money have to use it for a while as no resale value.."

Phone heated quickly
Mobile network is bad"

Super fast finger print and faceunlock। Best battery with fast charge। Excellent  Only cons little bit heavier then other phone having 5000 mah battery।
The mobiles is a good buy. Amazon has not been able to set right my query that the payment was made by sbi card and it is showing as net banking to deny me 10% discount. Please be aware.
"Till now it's good. Camera is good enough to capture images perfectly both in day n low light. Battery performance is satisfactory and runs for a day+. No heating issue, No lags. Overall good to have it."
"I am using this smartphone for more than one month and I'm happy with its all great features.
Pros-
Camera quality is really awesome
Performance is very fast no lagging during gaming
Cons-
-Not satisfied with wide angle camera pictures
- mobile is heavy in weight. It's take time to comfortable with this bulky phone."
Fingerprint is good

Sound Quality is very Good. On this price is a good choice.
"So, a much hyped and reviewed phone, that i think is extremely primitive and fails to deliver on all its promises. I have been using this phone for a little over a month and i am ready to talk about it.

Let's begin with it's form. Looks like a 5 year old design.

Interface - from the thick ancient font to silly round folders, this one looks like the first generation smartphone. Even Taking a screenshot is such a tedious task.

Camera - Mega pixels is a farce. There is hardly any pixel depth. You can't even zoom in 10% on the photo you've taken. The quality of image sucks. Finding focus is another issue. Image correction has limited tools.

From a non functional fm radio to low ability to capture signals amd internet, i am yet to find one good thing about this phone.

Please please go for the redmi note series if you arr confused between the two. My sister has one. The tech reviewers should be sp@#*&ed for recommending this over Note pro 7.
Atleast the display, interface and user experience is up to date and looks like a contemporary phone."
"Good Smartphone at this budget segment.Everyone says phone gets heating Yes I will heat when your in gaming only.The heating is just similar to other phones so we can’t say mistakes by heating problem
Overall this is a beast to me"
"Please don't buy this phone ,facing network issue, touch is not working"
Sometimes hangs. Camera is ok. Battery is ok.
Good
"The second day of usage,I dropped the mobile from a 2 feet height, it feel on a concrete floor and the display broke badly along with the rear camera glass and few scratches on the back, I called the service center and they told it will take 3 months for them to receive the spare for this product as it launched just a week before. The mobile is very fragile, poor build plastic at the rear, I was using Asus Zen phone Max pro M1 which I played like football, feel lot of times from a charger level height it still intact, don't expect Xiaomi or Asus level durability in this mobile.. Its a awesome fancy mobile,till you drop it once :-)"
Speaker working failed within 2 days
Not bad

I bought this phone recently and features are really good. Battery stands for a day even if data is on for entire day. Camera clarity is amazing. Finger print helps well.
"Face recognition not accurate...open with close eyes also.
Fingerprint sensor is also slow & take time to response.
Image quality gud in outdoor but very poor in indoor & low light. Need update to fix these things..
Amoled Display quality is awesome
Comporomise in build quality not as per Samsung brand standards."
"It is a decent phone - especially  considering the price category it falls in.

Display is excellent  - one of the best I've come across.

In my opinion, the battery life is not as great as the marker has made it out to be. It is not bad, either. Phone can last for a day if the usage is average to above average.

Camera is very strange - it clicks nice pictures and has a lot of options. But, the pictures are not high definition  and lose out on clarity (something that can be easily seen if you zoom in on any clicked picture : appear extremely pixelated).

Speakers are decent.

Facial recognition is not good. It is too slow in well-lit areas and doesn't work at all in areas with low-light even if I put the backlight function on.

Fingerprint reader is decent. Works most of the time. Suffers from the prevalent problem in almost all readers - doesn't work if fingers are even a little bit sweaty/dirty."
"Cheap network quality, even having full network, voice is braking.... Fed up with this problem"
Very nice mobile
Will miss nostalgia ... everyone please kick tushar
"Very poor camera quality, flash is not working with photo mode, only works with live focus, battery life is about 2 days for average user.fingerprint reader is fast.
When photos zoom in, it lacks quality . When taking photos with photo mode cannot zoom in."
Good products
Waste of time. I could not even get in there today because there was a football game. The wanted me to pay $10 just to park. How stupid is that! 2 days before Christmas. I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall. Goobye and good riddens. I have better things to do with my time and money.
Phone is working good...but charger stopped working in 2 days...

"One of the good options provided by Samsung in budget phones. It is far better than Chinese products like redmi, realms etc. as far as user interface, touch screen is concerned. I have used Mi max for three years.

SAR value is one of the most important criteria which one should check before buying and Samsung is clearly a winner in this domain. High radiation may cause serious health issues. Studies may take many years to reveal its effects. Why to take risk.
Camera and sound quality is good in this segment and in comparison  to Chinese phones."

THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE MOTHERBOARD.

After one week service center replaced the motherboard.

But it is very unfortunate to get motherboard change in a new phone."

"As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale, the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch. At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio. Other than the ambiance, the food is some of the best fresh local food I've tasted. A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese... Can you say tasty? My mouth waters just thinking about it. Walking in, the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest you'll ever meet (and the funniest). When you go, make sure to save room for dessert... the cheesecake of the moment is always a win!"
I took mobile 10 days back. It worked fine for 2 days. After two days it started strucking like 4 years old mobile. Not able to open camara also

"After using 15days , finally I can consider that this product is really trustworthy.
I am using vivo phone for first time and yes, it doesn't disappointed me.
-The processor in it is really awesome even it is better than your expectations.
Some of SD-675 doesn't contain with Kerin 460 ,but it has which provides you more smoothness for running apps.
-4gb ram with 64gb internal storage is a nice combination for daily tasks and running games.
-others competitive phones in this price segment can't beat this U20 model in accordance with the quick service. It's more
Quick because it has UFS-2 , which is more quick then EMM chip.
- camera with bokeh mode is genuine.
Others lenses are pretty good.
- box contain with a 18W fast charger which takes max 2hous to take full charge.
- a simple screen guard applied on the phone screen .
- Battery is big .
- Google assistant response quick.

"My mom and my son and I went to old town on a Thursday to check out some galleries and listen to some of the buskers! So after our perusing we stopped to get ice cream. 

Real ice cream! Petersen's is a really cool place and it's brand new! Just opened 11/23 I think. Well they have lots of great flavors like Georgia Peach, NY Black Cherry, Cappuccino, Peppermint with real peppermint, lots of sorbet, lots of chocolate stuff that I didn't want to try, and old favs like cookie dough, butter pecan etc. 

They also sell pints and also gallons I think! 

The staff is super cool and well educated about the history of the shop. I think the girl said they originated in Chicago and that the tiles in the ceiling are from the original location! I just thought that was so cool! She also said that they could sub the milk in your lattes and coffe with ice cream to make pepperment lattes and more wild flavors! I thought that was pretty rad. 

Anyway, if you are in old town I highly recomend you check this place out!"
"After 10 days of us.
It's a budget phone
Alexa is honestly useless as can't do much.
Alexa hands free only works if GPS is on so consumes a lot of battery.
Google assistant is definitely a winner here.
Excellent camera front & back
Camera has a lot to offer and a lot of tweaks. AI camera.
Phone is heavy
OEM case is neat in the box and has good grip.
Does not look premium though
Battery is not that great
Internal & external speakers are great
Life-like gaming. Really impressed
Screen is amazing. Online video play are superb and can see upscaling.
UI is amazing. Simple and clean"

"I've eaten breakfast here a few times and always thought the food and service were good. I think the prices are reasonable. My only complaint is the place is too small. there have been many times the hubby and I go there and there is simply nowhere to sit, so we end up leaving. I wish they would expand the dining area as I would love to eat here more. I hate chain restaurants, but when this place is too crowded I end up at a crappy chain."

I am writing this review after 2 months of usage of samsung M20. I always buy midrange phones 10 to 14k but this worst . Trust me guys. And if you are mi user u would be dissatisfied big time. Few bad things i want tell - fingerprint does not work even if youch 4-5 times and it does not have vibration on fingerprint . No vibration on keyboard. Dual camera but no good blur effect. And worst part is that if you stand 2meater from camera facing camera then only it can create blur . If want to click object or if more than 1 person . It does not detect properly. Looks fake blurr. Front camera is also worst.  I would say worst cameraa of the segment. Dont buy samsung mid range phone. Its bad even after softwareupdate. Few more things . Watch any youtube review about m20 for more bad things. I line suggestion dont buy M series. This might be another reason its not availble on shops.
"They could have improved the features on this phone, but as usual, the phone is laggy at times."
Awesome phone with pathetic fingerprint reader!!
"33 minutes left before my flannel hobbit shoes get wet  RAIN, PLS GO AWAY!"
"Disappointed!

Bought this for my sister and afyer 3 months of usage the phone sits with me, she was done with it it seems.

Camera is the biggest downside, 2 major updates and now the clarity is tottally gone.

Not to mention thr battery , drains like anything and worst thing is that while chargin it heats up lile a fry pan.

Network issue is the next thing, network connectivity drops frequently and tested using another phone with same carrier and the other phone had no issues ( samsung galaxy note 3)

Totally dissappointed by the buy.

Delivery speed : 5/5
Product performance 2/5"
This is an amazing product best value for money m really happy to get this blindly go for it without any hesitation
"Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family. You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit. Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson. We even have birthday parties here!

"Love my M20 phone.

"I received package without a seaaled cover, I have done the unboxing vedio, cause can't trust  what's may be in the order. After 1 month it has lot of touch screen problem...not working properly"
Good phone for the price
"Camera quality also not good takes long time to save photo and can’t haves enough quality based on 48 MP. Battery not working nor then 10 hrs if using Internet and application. I don’t think so it has 6000 mAh battery. The major problem with these set are drop of network. It always drops while using Internet of watching live video.

According to me I am using this mobile but I can’t suggest anyone to purchase it."
It is a very good phone at this price when I read the details of this phone I was greatly surprised . So I thought to buy this. It's overall good product. The most surprising thing was the battery backup of the phone at this price. I would give it 5 star.
"fingerprint reader is good but some time they do not unlock, camera quality is good but blur is not so good, battery life is excellent i use my phone 14 to 18 hours without charge my phone."

"I'm giving this review after using 2weeks
Worth buying,obviously this cell phone is budget phone but far better performance compared to the others cell phones,i used Mi
Phones,real me phones, vivo phones, but always facing one problem in each n every cellphones,i don't know why
Radiation this is the worst problem in all three  cellphones which i already used they r giving better cameras,better battery life etc etc
But no improving problem of radiation
But, but in samsung which I'm currently using i didn't see any sign of radiation problems such as headache, eye start burning after long use,no sweat on the screen while talking for long time,not very much heating while gaming,this is also the things one should know about all problems like this while planning to buy a good cellphones,bcoz we have to take care of our health n I'm suggesting to buy Samsung cellphones bcoz i think they know very well about human nature n what things is positive n negative for cellusers,
So after using this Samsung m10s cellphone i m giving a genuine review hope you all will understand my suggestion

Only battery drain fast after a month so battery performance has to be improved
Battery pack up is not satisfied....
"I initiated a return for this product as there are some camera glitches. When replacement and return was initiated there was IMEI mismatch due to which my product was taken and was put on hold with no status change. And today when they returned the product back to me saying there is imei mismatch they cannot accept it,  I found out that the imei they were carrying was of another product samsung m30s which i bought together with my oneplus 7t. Such a great negligence by amazon and a havoc they have created by their pathetic service. Worse than ever. They are troubling the customers for no reasons and i think have trained all their customer executives to just assure the customer with their words & fill their survey will shinning colours and no action takes place."
Product is awesome. I m using it so smoothly

"1. The phone gets overheated during charging and during continuous use for(call/surfing/gaming)  more than 30 mins.
2. The mic/mouthpiece is so poor, to receive the voice by normally holding the phone by ear. Every time the person on other side of the call asks to repeat the voice (as unable to listen properly) or to talk loudly.
3. It asks for unlocking using primary password/pattern(No finger or face recognition accepted) to start the phone after every restart/switch-on. And every time we restart the phone we need to apply the password/pattern to start the phone functioning.(It doesnot automatically starts as other brands)"

Buying a Online Phone is creating some bad experience to me ,i will think 20 times when i will purchase any thing from online sites ."
"The burgers here are pretty average.  Thin, flat, kind-of greasy patties with lettuce and tomato.  But what sets this place apart is their other offerings.  My husband got the tri-tip steak sandwich and he said that it was delicious.  The meat was very tender and cooked perfectly.  I loved the fact that they serve sweet potatoes fries.  Those have become very popular lately but this is the only fast food place I know of that has them.    The ones I tried were cooked perfectly and very lightly salted.  The onion rings were also cooked just right with no soggy pieces.  I thought that the batter to onion ratio was slighly scewed toward the former but my hubby thought they were perfect.  Their regular fries are also very good.  I tried the chocolate shake and it was really yummy too.  I think its great that you can get a veggie burger here as well as a tuna steak sandwich.  The extra toppings they offer such as sauteed mushrooms, avacado, and teriyaki and BBQ sauce are all a big plus as well.

The decor is simple since it is a fast food joint.  The booths were big and comfy and the faux leather looked slightly more upscale than you would expect.  We went on opening day so the service was phenominal.  We didn't have to wait long for our order and everything was to our specifications.  Servers came by serveral times to pick up trash and offer to refill our drinks.  The restroom was very small but clean. I try not to eat fast food too often but I will consider coming back next time I am craving a burger.  Or maybe I'll give one of their salads a try.  They earned a repeat visit from me and an extra star since they donated 100% of their opening day profits to Phoenix Children's Hospital.  A big thanks to Sarah S for posting that on Yelp events page so that we could contribute... and fill our bellies!"
Working good
Was working fine but after the last update phone is heating up on simple usage and battery drain is faster . Buy only after reading the latest reviews.

"Good speaker.
Good camera, macro specially and night mode.
Good display.
Oxygen OS is great as you already know.
Gamming is good but may increase temperature some times.
Battery drains fast if screen refresh rate is set up to 90hrzs.
Fast charging can do a full charge within 20 min I guess.
The given silicon cover will become red from transparent eventually.
No 3.5 mm headfone jack, so bought a Bluetooth one.
Amazon exchange policy is bad. Delivery boy came and can not scan the barcode, told that will be back in one hour. After getting out of my house, cancelled the order immediately. Amazon customer care is dumb. Say can not help with that any way. Raised a complaint but never get back to me. So have to order again with 3000 extra bucks."

"You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!!  

I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.  The crust is awesome, sauce and cheese just perfect!

The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.

The lobster ravioli were huge, easily enough for two.  Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.

You really can't dine here, so it's take out or delivery.  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could."

"Camera quality is just not up to the mark. It struggles to auto focus when you go closer to the object and you start to get blurred images.
Fast charging ain't fast enough.  Its slower than Bangalore traffic.

The phone has security patch from August. Being a hot selling phone Samsung should have bothered to release new updates. They should understand that corporate emails don't work if there aren't any security updates."

"We live in the neighborhood so were excited to see a new place with a huge range of beers open up.

The decorations are a bit sparse, but we like to sit on the patio or the conversation areas near the bar, which are perfect this time of year. Yucca chips are personal favorites, as is the gnocchi bolognese. Burger wasn't bad, but a burger is just a burger. They're still adjusting their menu it seems, which I expect any place to do for the first few weeks as they settle in.

I really love their commitment to craft beer, especially Arizona beers. $5 pitchers of AZ beer before 5:00 is not only quite a tasty offering, but appeals to my love of all things local.

Give OHSO a try!"
"Worst camera. Plastic body cheap. Good only on paper. Performance is worst. Hang and Lag issues r there
 Low Performance as compared to  Snapdragon 636. Screen is ok ok. Doesn't look like Samsung phone. PUBG frame drop issue. Not very smooth gameplay."
Touch is not at all good while gaming. Face sensor and finger sensor are very slow. Camera is avg. Phone is having a major issue with its display and touch. Remaining other feathers are very good for this phone.

"Have been using 7T for more than a week now. An awesome product launched by One+, with superb camera quality and inhourse security feature for app. The touch of the phone is super sensitive and really cool.
- Camera picture quality is super cool in all modes.
- Multiple options to choose the color display pattern
- Batter life as of now is good and full charges in less than 30 mins. However, more mAH batter could have been used.

- No slot for external SD Card. Though it is 128gb internal memory, more than 26 gb is gone on internal OS only."

Batter also good...

"The Vig is a breath of fresh air as far as the bar scene goes in uptown Phoenix. Nice ambiance, good vibes from both customers and employees, and overall a great concept. Anyone can come here and feel comfortable.

We went for burger night (Monday night people!), not knowing what to expect... Here's what to expect: a giant effing specialty burger (3 to choose from), cooked to perfection, served with a hearty portion of fries or sweet potato fries! FOR 5 BUCKS!

Our waiter was either stoned or really new at his job... I'll give him the benefit of the doubt even though he talked like Jeff Spicolli, and say that he was probably just new. But hey, I'm not gonna bitch on $5 burger night..."
Camera quality is very good and its size is perfect hence easy to handle but fingerprint sensor is not so good
"Good battery life
Very nice camera
Good fingerprint reader"

"i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately 2 times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago.  the atmosphere is pretty awful, but the food is amazing.  i get a #86, which is a noodle, tofu, and vegetable soup (the broth is meat based).  it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day.  everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well (though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones). highly, highly recommended."
Value for money product

"I honestly moved from Oneplus 3T to Oneplus 7T.
I don't like other android phones due it's UI, love stock android.
Camara is awesome especially the macro mode

I was expecting great battery but its still its good as compared to 3T amd iphone cameras

As i moved from 3T to 7T, I had to buy the type C jack which was a little frustrating

Coming on to features
Design - 4/5
+Reduced notch
+Premium glass back
+Camera bump

Performance - 5/5
+Latest and greatest hardware
+Smart optimisations

OS - 4.5/5
+Smooth Android experience - Oxygen OS

Display - 4.5/5
+Butter smooth 90 Hz Amoled display - treat to the eye

Battery -4/5
+Fastest charging ever seen
+Slight less capacity

Camera -4/5
+Overall good output with all 3 cameras
+ Amazing macro mode
- Misses details and messes up with Colors sometimes

Audio - 4/5
+Clear and loud - quality output

CONS
NO Headset jack. Had to buy as mentioned above
One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.
Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 )

I received One Plus 7T 20 days back and i am describing you my experience after 20 days.

Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.

Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.

The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%. am among the first to buy this phone without prime membership.

Posting this review after 4 weeks of using the phone. I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good.

There is no lagging issue till now.

The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first.

Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos provided,one without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit.

Speakers are loud and produce decent sound. Haven't checked the selfie camera and the video recording till now.

Thanks Amazon and OnePlus"
Sim signal receiver not good compared with other phones. The same sim i used in S8 was good but in M30s it is comparatively poor
"I have to replace my current Pixel phone as it had become too sluggish. I loved Pixel's camera and was planning to buy Pixel 4 but alas it didn't launch in India. So I wanted to check for other phones and decided to reduce the budget of the phone. I wanted a decent camera, UI close to stock android and a good camera. I have used OnePlus2 before so I decided to go for the latest OnePlus 7t and its a fabulous Phone for this price range.

PROS
- Awesome camera (not pixel but very good)
- The battery lasts longer and warp charge is super fast
- The display is very good
- Build is nice

CONS
- Not a big fan of the camera bump and setup but it's subjective (maybe someone may like it)
- The display is not end-to-end like 7Pro and 7T Pro but not enough. 7t pro is definitely looking gorgeous but almost 14k more expensive.

Also got it in Diwali offer so the deal was good."
Good phone
Very slow phone. As compared to other mi phones. Display is also very poor.
"I will recommend this great phone for all, who is looking for a good smartphone below Rs 20k. Good battery life, ample storage, plus excellent overall performance. Thanks."
"Purchased 12GB version, there are issues with fingerprint scanner,GPS. Accessing media files on internal storage is little slower.May be due to 256GB ROM. Overall not happy with the product."
Realy nice phone considering price tag and offers camera is good for day to day purpose
I think i got a defective product. I'm facing a lot of touch issues. I don't know it's a common issue or not. Anyway very bad experience when it comes to Amazon support
Good phone
"The best thing in this phone is battery life, camera quality is not good compaired to other brands with 48MP. Fingerprint is also not good compaired to A series mobiles in Samsung."
"Pretty good phone, works pretty fast for daily use.
Nothing to complain about."

Honest review..  Cheap build quality. Lags in  camera... Front camera will get black when in ise... A average battery.. I dont think you should spend yoir money on this one....go for Mi4 rather than this
"Nice phone ,camera quality outstanding, meet my expectations, working super"
"1. Not Call record Option
2. Not Dual App Option
3. Not Default Ringtones
4. And Many Different from MIUI OS"
Bad product for Samsung the phone is hang and working not properly. Waste for money.
 Good but defective.android system web view installation failure. vibartes when a recepient receives call despite of the disability of the vibration settings

"This was just ok. I got the steakhouse salad, which came with four pieces of meat the size of quarters. I'm sorry, but that's no $13 salad. I had to send it back, because I asked for the meat to be cooked through and it was rare.

My dining partner said her pizza was tasteless.

It was very loud.

In all, it was too much money for what we got. We won't go back."
Its too heavy to hold in ur hand....otherwise nice phone in this budget...
Yeah for sure
The company does not disclose the sum it applied for .
Phone apparently doesn't give earphones with it. Disappointed
Awesome performance
Awesome product..Thanks Amazon .. I m your new customer and you fulfill my hopes Thanks
"Worst mobile. Not even lasts for 1 month. Brought this mobile on 27 August 2019, in the first week it hangs and lags heavily and then it stopped working on 10 September 2019. It not even powered on. Since the return date is over, I can't return it. I think it's a fake product or something"
Not value for money gandu mobile
"This is my first OnePlus mobile phones purchase. I was not sure whether it is worth of all the hype but this mobile has everything which was promised by company. Best display, best speakers, best camera, fast charging, good battery life. There is nothing to  complain for such price...

Delivery by Amazon was also super fast. Got it within 24 hours."
"Worst product I ever purchased. Touchscreen sensitivity is poor: I end up having a lot of typos when I type fast, many keys randomly act either sticky or miss. Sometimes the screen doesn't respond at all so that I've to turn off the screen and turn it on again to try again. Also,  the screen has developed a white coloured area along its borders where the sensitivity is almost zero: Can't type 0 or p any more using my favourite keyboard,(typing this using Samsung's crappy keyboard which places both letters slightly differently. But it delivers two p's instead of one). A visible scratch like mark is developed in the bottom right corner of display (beneath the screen). GPS is faulty. Camera is below average and it can't handle low light despite the claim. Only thing good about this phone is its massive battery but to make the most use out of it, I had to remove or disable numerous bloatware first."
"Battery - good
But camera 3rd class
Its complete scam of 48mp ( if you zoom the image its waste of money)
If you buy for camera than switch to vivo or samsung
Otherwise all function and system work good."
Good product but stop working after 2 days of delivery.later replaced by Amazon in next 3 day and now working fine.
I was sad to hear they shaved too  I really liked the beards. I feel like I`m in the minority.

"This place hits everything on my ""it's Awesome"" list. 
First off it's a family run little place.
Second it's in a hole in the wall area.
Thirdly and most importantly it is all made in house. 
Fourtherly it is awesome

We were in Gilbert staying at a friend's house for spring training, GO DODGERS!!! We hit the usuals, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts, Dodger Dogs at the game, and our friends asked do you like sandwiches?
If there is one food group that I love, it has to be the Sandwich group, and 
this place is one of my top 5 sandwiches stops of all time.

We ate in the Lounge(y)(ie) area, which has a more adult vibe going on. We first started with their fresh bread, and tomato basalmic vinegar salsa(y) thing. Which was great, we had two rounds of that while we drank our beverages, and waited on our sandwiches.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the potato salad, and the wife ordered the Chicken breast sandwich, with pasta salad. My sandwich came out perfectly, from the fresh Ciabatta Bread to the outstanding roasted pork. 

I would order this pork just by itself; it was juicy, and full of flavor, just like my Cuban grandmother makes. While this sandwich is a true Cuban sandwich, not using swiss, and not being pressed, it is not advertised as an actual Cuban, just a Cuban style, like me.

Now this potato salad was some of the best I have ever had, and not just because it had bacon, which is awesome, but the use of yukon gold potatoes, instead of red, or russets has been a revelation to me. This is how I am going to prepare all off my potato salads from now on.

After all that I still ordered the carrot cake, which like everything else is made in house with local ingredients, it was warm with a not overly sweet cream cheese frosting. The wife got the lava cake with some beer ice cream. Even though I ate most of my carrot cake, and loved it, I wish I had a full gallon of that beer ice cream, it was just perfect. In fact I am planning another trip out that way, just for that ice cream."
"Sometimes the caller is not able to hear us on speaker phone calls, microphone not good, speakers are not loud enough."
Gonna go watch Jackson`s band play and then going to the band after party
"Good Display,good in selfie.
But back camera is very poor quality,
Finger print reader give access very slowly,
If you have idea to buy this better to directly check camera in showrooms."
It has amazing battery life . Camera is bad . Fingerprint unlock is not quick compared to redmi oppo . Display is good . If you are looking for great battery life this is the phone .
"We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service, but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place.  However, we had a really unprofessional experience here recently.  We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee (because as she under her breath, notary services were a pain).  This employee could not help us either as ""he had never seen anything like it, and he didn't know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it.""  I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home. While we waited for this man to do something, the employee who handed off our paperwork, tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and (sorry) hickish about these ""stupid"" machines.  After looking at all was going on, we didn't want anyone here handling our notary services.  Eek - felt like we dodged a bullet.  Also, don't think I will be going there for any other services.  I felt like my IQ dropped 20 points when I went in there."
Nice product oppo
" sweetie pie, buttercup, married ppl share hehehehehe.....this includes ur shoe collection  I am trading UP!"

"Phone itself is great but what i don't like are
Bugs occur often
Camera at night isn't that well
Battery backup is less as compared to its performance"
"Got a problem with M30, touch screen automatically stop working.. don’t know how to deal with this situation.. please help to resolve issue"
"Great phone in the price range, equipped with amazing cameras, both main and selfie. Fingerprint and face id are fast as well. And the best feature for me is the battery life...no frequent charging even after heavy usage. Also very light and handy considering battery capacity. Samsung's brand name always makes decision easier. Certainly recommended!!!!"
"No issues Don't fall for the negative reviews. This is best at the price. People following red mi phones but this has bigger advantage. I will write only advantages and cons and feedback

Advantage
-Amoled display.
-Always on display (I compromised but it's there)
-5000 Mah battery and runs 2 days.
-Fast charging and 15W charger in the box.
-Wide angle camera is awsum.
-No heating no lagging.
-Face unlock is very fast.
-Mainly look is stunning.....
-Very low radiation
-Blue light filter
-Lock screen story and stunning pics.

Cons
-Little slippery in hand but trust me a 99 Rs cover solved it straight away.
-Online availability.(Now in stock)
-No splash proof (as per the other reviews as I am not going to test this anyway?

Feedback

feedback
-People say camera but I find it's too good.
-People say speaker. One in the bottom is loud and clear enough.
-People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43

After Using for 1 week
-All well and amazing.
-Working in Telcos with lost of calls phone still has 30% batt on second day. To add i have played game for 30 min and watched online movie for 3 hrs on Jio cinema along with hectic job schedule."
alright don`t want you to overdue it now. LOL you are funny  nite nite
Best phone under 9999 its very comfortable to use like fingerprint and all but camera quality is not to good
"4.5 Stars... I really enjoyed Beckett's table! It's a large, cool looking room with exposed ceiling and brick walls. They have a small patio and I heard they're planning to build a large patio on the side of the building. 

I met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items: 

The drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines. I tried the Palmaire, a lemonade/pomegranite combo. Very refreshing! 

We had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start... I love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites. It came with roasted red pepper tomato soup. The soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers; I would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste. 

The roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous; intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside. 

The fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty. The corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast. I tried a bite of my friend's short rib - very tender and lean. 

We ended with the creme brulee, which came with fresh blackberries. At first I passed on having bites (I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee), but they pressured me into trying it... YUM! I may be a convert now. 

Overall, a great pick! Shout out to Katie B. for the suggestion."
gdgd well i better go and get ready for work :| haha have fun tonight  x x
"I want to make love to a cream puff sundae.  Maybe even marry one.  They're that good.  Other than totally awesome desserts, this pace is a dump. The g-damn flickering fluorescent lights give me a headache.

once you buy the product it will be another worthless Chinese product. Very poor camera quality, battery life is not at all good. the people who gave review as good are paid users i guess. Trust me guys never go for samsung products.. they just want to compete in market saying like we are also brand . by wasting or using customers money nicely"

"This little place is great, the service, the tacos, the guac, and the prices!"
Best mobile in this price. I love it. Value for money rest all specs you all know. One more thing i didn't get ads on it.
"It's a good phone works perfectly fine and smoothe but sometimes lack during heavy gameplay or elongated gameplay, processor and RAM can be improved I would suggest you to buy the galaxyM30 instead if it fits the budget...otherwise in this budget this phone is among the top of the line phone with fully loaded specs and features."

"If I were to have written this review 2 years ago, it would have been 5 stars, but the portions keep on shrinking at an alarming rate. Today I had the meat plate and no more than 2 tablespoons of pulled pork, and brisket were on the plate. Also, what's with the staff? They are like robot drones! Absolutely no personality! The food's flavor, and quality, however, are very good, the place is always sqeaky clean.. and of course the decor is very amusing. Being a hungry hungry hippo, I would prefer a slight price increase, to maintain portion size."
"Battery backup is wonderful. I never experienced this much battery backup in any 4000mah phone.Beacause of AMOLED display, 720p resolution and updated soc. Battery backup is just double than any other mi devices with 4000mah.

Camery quality is awesome👌
Build quality is very good. phone size is wonderful for one hand use.👍
Fingerprint is little disappointed.verry slow response than physical FP reader.👎
Wonderfully AMOLED display.👍
Gaming experience is very good, no lag in PUBG, COD, or PES.👌
Loud and clear sound .👌
😀😃🥰🥰🥰🥰"
The battery of the phone is ultimate . The camera is good but not competitive .Overall phone is good .
No clarity
No one should give this specification in this price just go for it
All good but I am not satisfied buy its smoothness it has very bad work and lagy type  don't buy this phone I agree that this phone has big battery life but don't buy
it`s ridiculously warm in bed

Hang over the call ..
"The main reason for the four stars is for their Angus Roast Beef Dip -- it is delicious!  It is up there on my list of favorite French Dips. The meat is super tender and juicy, and the horseradish spread really compliments the sandwich. Plus, it is a great condiment to dip your french fries in.  

The portions are huge -- my sister ordered the Sesame Chicken Salad and she barely ate half of it. I, of course, devoured my sandwich. They have a huge menu, with a lot to choose from. They seem to be known for their pizzas, which look really yummy too.

The atmosphere is similar to most sports bars, although I'd say this place is more of a ""high-end"" sports bar with chandeliers and mood lighting instead of ripped vinyl and dirty blinds.  There is a massive flat screen TV. above the bar, and little ones interspersed throughout the restaurant. The wait can be a bit long on Friday nights and weekends, but you can call ahead to get your name on the wait list.  And, they are nice enough to offer you some small pizza bites while you wait.

Overall, BJ's is your standard chain restaurant/sports bar, but with a few extra niceties to make it stand out above the rest.  I'll be back for sure, and maybe next time I'll venture outside my love-for-the-french-dip and try some of their other goodies."

"I love the concept of this place. There are three different restaurants each serving breakfast, lunch or dinner. This was the first time I went to the Farm Kitchen, since I usually go to the other place for breakfast. Anyway, their lunch did not disappoint. What I love about their place for breakfast, was delivered for lunch. There were yummy sandwiches, salads, side dishes, and dessert. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was perfect. It was loaded with mayo, which I hate. It had full of flavor! I ate my sandwich outside in the sun surrounded by trees. Great place to take visitors too!"

Very poor camera quality. Felt cheated."
On the way home.
Processor a bit slow. UX Lacks basic shortcuts and conveniences even after upgrading to pie. Lots of limitations . Only good for 5kmah battry at 12k. Lasts a good 1.5 day. A bit of Touchscreen issue's as well. Charcoal Black looks like dark blue.  Average but could have been better. (18 days of usage)
"Battery life is good,picture quality is nice,but camera is average...front camera quality is low..."
"Phone is good, but some applications hang some times."
It does not support mobile data for video and PUBG . The connection breaks every now and then..
"Everything is great except the battery life but warp charge (30W charger) charges the phone in about 1 hr, so that makes up for the small battery. If the battery was just a little better then it would have been great but still the best budget flagship phone."
Camera is not up to the mark.
If you are looking for picture perfect phone then go for it...
Everything in this phone is just outstanding except for the front camera.. position of the camera is very poor. Face looks too big when you click a selfie.

"So I'm apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.

Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.

This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.

I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit."
Good smart mobile

"Met a friend here for lunch & had a great experience. I've been meaning to get here for a while, having heard great things. Unfortunately didn't get to sample the wine menu. But the lunch offerings were good - turkey sandwich was very flavorful with its crumbled goat cheese, vinaigrette, and fig jam on 9-grain bread. Such a large sandwich runs the risk of being dry, but no problem here. My friend got to enjoy the sausage mac & cheese; I was tempted by some of the other versions on the menu - next time for sure. Also, the place wasn't too crowded for lunch - no problems getting a table or parking."
Nothing special
I think it's hasn't good camera...so build camera mega pixel in Samsung m20.I'm not satisfied for not only camera and battery also drain fast and phone is over heated(use online and offline)...I suggested don't  buy this phone...I really upsetd for this performance..
"Amazing phone at the budget of ₹15000

Pros
- You get a good battery backup of 24hour+ (if you don't play game and use mobile for normal usage and internet)
- Phone does not lag while you play game
- Superb Video quality
- Design is very beautiful (gamma green)
- Camera Quality is just wow with 64 mp camera plus you get lot of other camera features and good photo quality even in low light.
- Finger print scanner response is very quick
- Quick Charge
- You can insert SD card as well as 2 sims
- No heating problem felt even while playing game for an hour

Cons
- Alexa does not respond quickly. Instead Google assistant is amazing
- Screen size is big so using with one hand will be a problem
- Phone is 200g so i will feel heavy if you hold the phone with one hand and watch video.
- Low light and zoomed clicked photo is not good
- Pre installed useless MI apps keeps poping up ads. Well you can disable that.

Overall, I loved this phone at the price. Camera is amazing in day light. Quick charge solves my problem and a good design.
Was never been Xiaomi customer before but now recommend it."
"There were so many republicans talking out their asses, they needed Ricolas for suppositories. #GOPDebate"

"Despite being heavy in RAM and good processor speed, the phone has heavy lagging issue. I was unable to install even whatsapp for first 1 hour and when finally it was installed, it kept on crashing every 10 minutes. Forget about restoring the backup on the apps, even newly installed app had trouble running. Don't know it was the problem with my phone in particular or with m20 series in general but despite trying to make it work for 24 hours, I had to finally return it. Thanks to amazon that it was returned promptly, though I am yet waiting for return of my money since last 2 days. I was using moto g 4 earlier and despite having only 2gb RAM, moto was much faster than m20 which has 4 gb RAM. Is it because of heavy and RAM intensive customizations done by samsung, that only samsung will be able to tell. If samsung really want to compete with xiomi, they should better work less on the android customization and any customization should be optional rather than putting load on phone in the form of bloat ware. If it is not because of customization, then they should verify the supplier of their hardware whether declared specifications are actually usable. Anyhow, not at all satisfied with Samsung m20."
"A Foxy, Rowdy Republican Debate. #GOPdebate @megynkelly really disappointed me. Biased much? http://t.co/rRqNTAAK3X"
"I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review.  Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds.
It seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....

I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.

First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:
1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??
2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.
3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.

At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?
Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.

I finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.
WTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.

At this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!

Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea

I haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!

No.  NO.  A thousand times NO!

Red Robin is my next burger stop.  Period"

Working good but camera quality poor battery life is good Face unlock is not working properly dialling option is delay
"This phone has only one issue which makes it a bad option.

Samsung offer this phone at low price with many useful features like fast charging, face lock, fingerprint scanner and the main feature is its battery capacity( 5000 ah). Its cameras is good for capturing photos but not good for making videos. Display of the phone is excellent. Phone's design looks awesome. You can play pubg smoothly in medium graphic. Face lock and fingerprint scanner works good. Phone contains all the sensors which are needed. This phone charges quickly. Battery life is good"

"Battery life is not according to 6000mAh.
Also there is heating issue.
I don't know if it is for my mobile only.
But it if quiet a frequent.
While charging temperature is quite high.
While charging it shows fast charging but nope in actual there is no fast charging for this phone I think it's a myth."
One of the best phone to buy at this price. It's been three months I bought this phone. I'm happy with the performance and features except the camera quality. It doesn't look like 48mp. If you are looking for a camera phone don't go for it.
This is very good phone for reasonable price
Whatever I thought about this phone not good battery charging very slow.
is making everything fabulous tonight
"1. Fingerprint reader is fastest in the market.

2. Excellent OS. Great optimization.

3. Back Camera is really good.. Bt some times photos came over saturated. Clearly Selfie camera needs improvement.

4. 90Hz screen is classy, crisp and bright. That is a different experience you have to try it to understand. On the other hand for 90Hz display, battery gets affected.

5. For moderate users, Battery life is good for 1day usage(Over 6hrs screen on time).. But need one dedicated update for battery improvement. 30T wrap charger charges fron 20% to 100%  in 45mins.

Verdict:
Need software updates for:
1. Selfie camera photo quality
2. Battery improvement
3. Problem of Back Camera over saturated photos

This phone is absolutely a great buy in this price segment.

Oneplus surely looks for betterment. If oneplus will solve those issues, this phone will be close to a perfect phone almost."
"Simply go for it, its first of all make in India initiative. Unlike other Chinese smartphones whose main business is to spy and collect data from you but Samsung is different apart from all these Chinese phones and even it is build within India kudos for that.
1)Phone has a very good fhd+ display.
2)great 5000 mah battery.
3)4gb/64gb handles daily tasks of apps. I'm not a gamer but I think it can run all mid range games very well.
4)camera is good!
5)you can upgrade to andriod pie with dark mode!
6)battery longs for a day.
7)dosent heats up.
8)it has latest biometric unlock, but face unlock is not secured, go for pin and fingerprint!
9)the display is decent on direct sunlight!
10)it has Samsung u1 interface which is good.

Overall you can trust Samsung brand!"
"La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.

I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.

I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos."
System hanging
The phone gets very hot.. With use of 30 min only.. n also during charging.. It is enough hot as we can't use it to have a call.. Should I replace it Or use as it is
Superb phone display sound and camera

Excellent camera with real like pictures
"Best model at this price
Having awesome look as well as great performance.
I just love mi for it's features that makes it more better than other companies."
This is the best phone from Samsung you can get in this Price. It has a 5000 mAH battery with a fast charger inside the box. I bet no other company provides a 15W fast charger inside the box under 20000. It has Super Amoled Display. And M30 got its 1.1 Version of One UI which uses Android Pie. Doesn't heat even after playing Pubg for long. Camera quality is Decent. Fingerprint is fast enough. What surprised me was it's face unlock. Best phone under 15K
Battery life is not ok
Good
The 2015 target for net sales has been set at EUR 1bn and the target for return on investment at over 20 % .

Dislike is camera is not upto the expectations
Appearance not good

No glass protection"
Camera quality is worst......
Overall great phone
Actually it's my second my Poco phone. It's camera is far ahead than 48 mp marketing gimmick camera phones. Surely with time technology changes & same specs getting cheaper. That's why you were getting 29k priced phone at 19k . I like physical fingerprint sensor over on-screen one. It's face unlock works perfectly in low light or could say no-light conditions as well.

I loved this phone...
"This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech. 
They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!"
Not happy with phone play store not working properly camera quality not good as we expect from Samsung

"The OnePlus 7t is really smooth, but the battery drain quickly but It can last a day no problem with playing games and heavy usage"
"Camera quality is good.. A little bit struggle in using fingerprint sensor.. Toooooo much ads in this UI, different songs and videos keep running in background.. Accelerometer is also a problem,, when i watch videos on TikTok there is something like glitch, , that is very annoying and the biggest problem is network,, i have jio sim,, network tower and speed is very low compared to my brothers honor 7x(1.5 year older than this brand new phone),,,speed is that low that sometime i get irritated.. Build quality and screen is very good..
I hope samsung solve these problems in next update..."
"I have been using the phone for almost 5 months now. The phone is great in terms of touch, screen, battery. It is a treat to watch HD movies on the AmoLED screen. But when it comes to performance, its not up to the mark. I don't play any games, I just use the phone for my daily usage, even in this case, it seems to be lagging when handling multiple apps. My last phone (Redmi Note 3) was much better than this. When the battery goes below 20%, I have to literally wait for 2 sec for the phone to respond. I am now replacing the phone."
"Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We order the same thing... pizza wraps. they are good and fillng. iced tea hits the spot. Typical strip mall pizza."

"Came to town for work and remembered coming to Thai Elephant the last time I was in town and loving it. Walked here with friends and the name had changed. The wait staff saw my confusion and quickly reassured me that the name and menu had slightly changed but the food was basically the same. I had the curry fish last time and was craving it so I tried it again and yes, still absolutely delicious. Tried the calamari and crab wontons as appetizers. The calamri was solid but the crab wontons were only okay. A little too fried and in a skin that didn't feel like wonton skin. The curries that came to our table looked pretty neutral colored and the noodle dishes, instead of being on the red side or the dark brown side was also very neutral colored. Since I didn't taste those dishes, I can't legitimately penalize the restaurant but I have to admit that I hesitate to order anything else besides the fish because of their appearance. I'm still going to give this place 4 stars because of the taste of the food I ordered, the good service and the fact they had brown rice as an option. If ever I'm brave enough to stray off the path, my rating may change. But in the meantime, check this place out and order the curry fish on their specialties menu. I ordered it level 4 - hot and it was just the right amount of heat."
Network issue....  some times 4g network is not working in this phone so net speed is very low...  very bad experience
"Worst service battery issue
But not return option"
"Nice mobile
Camera quality is good..
Battery backup also good
Oppo should change headphone... Should give air tight"
"First of all I would like to say about the delivery which was too fast, I ordered it on 24/10/19 and got it on 25/10/19. Everything is good,camera quality and battery both are very nice good, but I haven't use the fingerprint sensor till now, so I can't tell anything about that.
Anyway, I thanks to Amazon both for the fast delivery and for selling the original and a great product at an unexpecting low price (rupees 7999)."

"Nice one with affordable Budget,  but battery back up should be better.
Overall good."
"I had received product in sealed outside packing but the product box was broken. Though product doesn't seems to be used or broken. I decided not to return product for that.
From initial usage seems good mobile. Not happy with fingerprint sensor as it takes 2 attempt atleast to unlock.
Screen and Battery is good and camera is also decent."
Fingerprint not good

"Back from holiday and had some amazing soups that made me reflect back on my experience here.  I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor."
Signal strength is low and bettery performance is not good which I had expected in Mi phones.
I bought two similar phones. One is working like a charm but the second one drained battery like hell. Got a replacement done and to my surprise the replacement phone is even worser
"Superb phone. Worth the price.
Pros:
Camera is brilliant. Both rear and front cam are really good. Ultrawide lens, slowmo and tiktok features on short videos gets a special mention
Excellent display. Full HD. Awesome clarity.
Love the color and rear glass. So solid
Super fast and efficient performance. No lag at all

Cons:
Battery life - lasts upto a day on normal usage (still ok)
Bought in Amazon sale, hence could not exchange my old phone"

"Samsung M20 is good budget phone with amazing features. A nearly borderless screen with an infinity-v waterdrop notch and charcoal body gives it an attractive appearance. The 6.3 inches screen with HD effect and high sound quality make this phone special to watch Netflix. The battary life is long enough to last for entire day and a half and TYPE-C charger gives it faster charging capacity. The ultra wide dual camera gives excellent result with accurate colors. The finger print unlock feature is also quick and unique. It is totally worth buying it.

"Worst product don't buy
Within 6 month screen became block"
Camera quality is very poor
"The M30 has a class-leading screen, which comes with the added benefit of further improved battery life - again to levels no competitor can match.
The Galaxy M30 is great all-rounder and makes a very compelling case for someone who doesn't find 3D gaming or camera performance particularly important. You still get to enjoy a very nice display and the outstanding battery life.
Pros
Exceptional battery life, okay charging speed.
One of the best displays you can have in the segment.
An ultra wide camera is hard to find in this class.
Good portraits, really nice selfies.
Dedicated microSD slot.
Cons
Plasticky build.
Unexciting image quality from the rear cameras.
No 4K recording even though the chipset supports it; no stabilization in 1080p either.
You can get a more powerful chipset at this price point."
"This product is really having too many defects.
Camera goes blank often.
Your WiFi/4g gets disconnected while taking.
Volume is the major issue, sometimes the audio will not work even though the volume is high.
Severe issues while connecting to Bluetooth.

I have never ever seen such many defeyin a new phone."
All good but weak want to get a earphones
Wrost product by Samsung. Just 4 month of my purchase it's display automatically damage and when I go care then say it's cost you and the cost is 6690. Both the product and Care worst service. I suggest you don't bye sumsung you can get same features with very low prices like mi or realme

"What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. ""Come on honey, it's an adventure!"". 

We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious! 

I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special ""gluten free"" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!

The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)"

4 Charging very fast ( full charge in 1 hour )
5 Alexa running smoothly (only it doesnt
  support mi tv yet)
6 Screen is soft and running smoothly.

If you are going to buy then prefer 128 gb rom variant because it will run out of space if you take much photos and videos with 64mp.

Best smartphone under 40k.Mind blowing performance and speed.the oxygen os is the best.only battery backup is above average besides that everything is great.
"Firstly no doubt it has a brilliant process in this price segment. It also suppose to have a good quality display, Fast charger is included in the box. It also has a premium build quality. Camera quality is average it doesn’t  performing as it shows on paper front camera is like rn5 pro. Sound  output from the speaker is very poor phone with lower budgets perform better in sound.
Gaming experience is very good, pubg mobile runs on smooth and extreme settings.
Other than that everything is good."

Ok so I've reviewed this place before, key words are wonderful creative dishes, a light touch for subtle flavor (right now I'm having a delectable plate of greens, shaved herbs, summer squash wrapped around burrata--- who woulda thought?) but most amazing is the heart warming genuine service of all who care for you here.  Oh.. And there's mightly fine wine on ""tap"". Heh heh.."
Fingerprint reader is very good and at right place. Camera quality is best in low light also. It's battery life is better than old samsung and other phones. Charging of battery is also very fast and good.
" Just finished setting it up and initial impressions have been very good. Although I have to say I was expecting a big box which had some extra goodies, like the many youtubers (including Indian ) had been showing. I would suggest OnePlus to at least include them as a part of a deal. Any way once I started using the phone, all my complaints started fading away. That 90 Hz display gives a butter smooth touch experience.

2 days usage Update:
*About the big box goodies mentioned in previous review above, they are available on OnePlus portal. So be ready to shell out money for the same.
*camera is not in the league of iphone 11 or Galaxy Note 10 or even Pixel 3 but it ain't that bad either. But Macro mode is a big saviour.
*Display is definitely the best part of the phone, along with the processor SD 855+
*Stereo Speakers can be pretty loud and clear
*Battery is again not as good as iPhone 11 or Galaxy S10+ but it would be enough for a day's usage. And why worry much when we have warp 30T charger
*I wish they could have included at least USB Type C Bullet earphones.
*Overall quite content with the phone."
"Moira isn't the best sushi I've ever had, but for Phoenix and my neighborhood and the pricepoint (as long as we don't order alcoholic beverages) is doable when we get a sushi craving.

Their spicy rolls are definitely spicy, and have some great kick to them.
It hits the spot without breaking the bank and we'll take it."
Very good
"Strolled in with a posse of 14 people for a birthday party. The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isn't huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time.

First off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril.

In addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef ""medium"" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I don't usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didn't think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didn't even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasn't like I was full, they just tasted bland.

For dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, you're outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream. 

The environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 14 of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded. Oh and just beware, the bill can become a little pricey if you aren't splitting entrees...."
Too bad

"What you feel and say if you have not got any CONS in a smartphone. Samsung M30 is that model. Samsung has really done good innovation with M30. The mobile is butter soft and fire speed. Here goes my reviews after using it for 3 weeks. I am always using a device experiencing it & testing then only busying myself on the keyboard to write a ""Review- A genuine review"" so that it can help other customer attached to Amazon. This M30 is definitely a Total Paisa Vasool for your hard earned money. I brought a 6/128GB variant on a lightening deal.

Camera - (Check the image clarity & crisp on the attached above image taken from M30 Autofocus mode) Average good color saturation and focus even Bookeh effect and Palm jesture options. This quality is more than enough for a daily or often usage. Don't expect a DSLR out of it ha ha ha.
Battery - Huge backup to run for more than a day. Thanks to SuperAmoled display
Processor - Ultra clock speed. Exynos is doing its job. As I played PUBG the most advanced graphic & RAM tester game ever made.
Design - Super cool & young generation style. Gradation look is something Unique from Samsung.
Sound/Audio - Dolby Atmos what more u want. Sitting in the crowded cab felt like Theatre Dolby experience crisp and clear+DUAL Sound effect of background+vocal speech in less volume you can hear all the details which I was missing in other smartphones till date. Even the Headphones earphones and also Speaker volume also too good due to Dolby Atmos sound engineering becos of this I felt comfortable in watching a movie over the Speaker which I never used with other smartphones till date used so far. The Bass of the Speaker u can feel it and on high volume also its not getting break.
Display - A unique MASSIVE FHD SuperAmoled on 6.4 inchs display (good battery saver known fact)
This M30 is Highly recommended. Buy and experience its magic performance then u will surely find my reviews true. Go for it don't think back!!!!  Thanks Amazon for fast delivery and the Seller for delivering me in a Good package. Buy today and experience smooth silky speed of Samsung M30."

The sushi is just okay (and you can get the same sushi at Geisha-a-go-go which is more fun).  The hamachi kama is just okay.  The steak is just okay.  Overall, this place is average.

I wish I had better things to say about it, but the service was not great (it was not bad, just average) and the bill was high considering the quality of everything we ordered.

Would I come here again?  Nah."

"its going very hot during call incoming and outgoing, all time seeing no network."
Finger print scanner location should be some below... Camera MP also should increase
Manufacturing defected handset.....Volume roker key are getting out
"Not worthy for price.
1. worst proximity sensor.phone blinks during call
2. No LED indication during charging.
3.No option to mute camera flick sound other than muting media.
4. If you are using earphones while taking call, it irritates. You will not get any option to lock the phone so that you can keep mobile and pocket and speak with earphones. I have removed power button option  to end call so that I can lock the phone and keep it in the pocket while using earphones.  Now there is no touch protection such that my phone speaker option gets pressed. call goes to mute.. it literally irritates. Even during normal time when phone is in pocket,Emergency numbers get dialed, camera turns on.  I really feel Lejovo K4 which j used from 2016 has better geatures than this.
5. Touch is so poor that you need to touch couples of times to open something or when disconnecting the call(not always).
6. Coming to the body of phone, while speaking in phone, the voice vibrations are felt in the real panel which irritates throughout the call.
7. I felt my old phone Lenovo  k4 which released 4 yrs back has more features  than this.
8. Before buying pls check carefully coz after buying you dint have option to return. You need to talk with customer suport and they will say we can replace but not return."

here are some of  the pros and cons
pros:
quick charge 4/5
battery life 4/5
camera 4.5/5
audio 4/5
bluetooth connectivity 4/5

cons :
stability 3.5/5 (was trying to update status on whatsapp app but every time it tried , phone was going back to home screen , did reboot the device but still same for had to wait for some time and the n turned device off and on then was able to us whatspp , also at the second day of use phone was lagging while normal use . didnt expect that on second day lol.)
night mode :3/5 ( i use night mode all the time, so after enabling night mode every time i unlock the phone , it goes to normal mode and then night mode , kinda annoying )
finger print :3.5/5 ( phone fails to detect finger for 2 out of 10 times so pretty annoying ).
notification drawer : when we use the phone from good coverage to low coverage phone still shows volte icon, even though the phone is not on 4g cause i have to turn on and off the airplane mode to find out that phone is on 2g or phone data icon is crossed .

Over all i m happy to use the phone but still this is first month of the use so cant say much .
i hope in the next update they will be able to solve the bugs"

"Not a good device at all. Battery life is ok. But the fingerprint reader sucks. Moreover, even the 25 megapixel camera doesn't give good detail photos. The camera lacks the basic features like night mode. Hyperloop, Super Slow motion and optical image stabilisation/ video stabilisation has not been given. The display is only 720p and even 4k video recording cannot be done. Therefore, spending ₹16000 for such a phone is a foolish idea. I have bought one such Samsung Galaxy a30s 5 days ago, and now struggling to sell this. Therefore, I recommend everyone not to get for it at all."

Battery Life detoriated after miui11 update. Overall a good experience after 15 days of power usage. Fingerprint scanner and face unlock is as smooth as it can come. No heating issue after extensive gameplay ( yes for Pubg phone will heat up but still very less compared to other phones). It might not look premium but  it's quite handy and you definitely got to feel the power in your hand."

In addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.

Anyone up for a burger?"

"As a pretty devoted Fry's shopper, I have to say this is one of my least favorite locations. Unfortunately, it's the closest one to me, so I end up there often. It's almost always crowded, the layout is less than intuitive, and I've gotten questionable produce on more than one occasion. The employees are friendly enough, but it's just no comparison to other locations.

By the looks of it outside, it seems like it would be pretty large, but once you get inside it's cramped and the selections seem limited. 

I suppose this is mostly things they can't change, but it's enough to make me drive a few miles out of my way to avoid it if I have the time."

"Divine,  the Carne Asada was so tasty,  flavorful and tender.  Everything we enjoyed tasted fresh and authentic. The guacamole was knock you socks off, traditional and limey, (I took my extra home and enjoyed the next day).  I liked what the previous reviewer who said also that the beans and rice are not an afterthought here, they are also amazingly well executed.  I am eager to get back an try the Chicken and Barbacoa as well as the roasted green chile cheese dip.   If your in the area of 44th Street and Thomas, forgo the big chain of Chipotle and show this lovey Phoenix gem some love, your taste buds will not be disappointed."
Best for use
Nice product good camera . battery life good.
More Battery capacity would have improved users experience.
The phone comes out with good perfirmance compared to other J and On Series phone. Display and Rear Camera clicks good pictures.. Software looks good. The front camera doesnt click with natural colours. Battery says to be 5000Mah but doesnt last for more than 24 hours.

*Camera is better than average. Photos are generally very good in broad daylight and good at night time.
*Performance is among the best in class. Speed is mindblowing.
* Gaming is smooth and extremely fast,no lags ,no hicupps.Best for gaming.
*Oxygen UI is amazing and very fun to use."
"One of the best phone under 10K. The thing I really appreciate about samsung is that they really acknowledge the mistake and act swiftly. The earlier model, M10 was having signal issues and battery drainage. They corrected both and i would like to say the mobile phone anteena is like a big magnet and you get crystal clear video call on normal 4G network apart from excellent voice call. I really recomand this phone for price consious people who are happy with good basic features and an avarage camera."

As a whole the phone looks nice but is unable to handle multiple apps running parallel. Also the fingerprint scanner seems to function with a delayed response. The phone quickly gets heated up while playing games. Also the phone lags while using keyboard during calls. But it has a great camera both front and back. Really takes nice clicks.
I CAN NEVER THINK IN MY DREAM THAT AMAZON WILL BETRAY ME IN SUCH MANNER.WITHIN 10DAYS OF PURCHASE I DISCOVERED VERY PECULIAR THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE.THE CHARGING PORT WAS DEFECTIVE AND NOW I AM RUNNING SHOP TO SHOP TO GET IT REPAIRED.

i had the appropriately called ""meat"" rustica and it was really good. this is the only the second place in phx i've had pizza that doesn't make me feel like i splashed my face in grease after. (grazi is the other).

But within 15 days my screen sensor got complaint. While making call the screen going blind and i cannot discconect the call. It took more than 12 days to get it back from service centre and now i am planing to sale it on second sales. I lost the confidence on Xiaomi Mi. Sorry to write this but this is the truth."

"15 days ago I bought a realme 3 mobile around 11000 rupees .But that mobile is a worst one. But this Samsung Galaxy M20  it's it's good .... This phone's Android experience is good, nice UI, nice sleek design, and I got an update to Android 9 Pie .... And another important feature its triple layer slot memory card, sim 1 sim 2 slots very nice ...But in camera section, the selfie cam is very bad and back camera is not that impressive.. But I am satisfied with my product because I have a highe-end variant mobile for photography... This mobile for moderate users and each and every software works very fine in this mobile. Especially live dictionary app ... but the display look so standard like a high end variant and battery that's a super 5000 MH battery and type C charger that is fantastic so in my personal opinion I am happy with this product I think a firmware update could improve their camera issue..... Thanks"

Product is good but build quality is very poor it's has amole display but not colour look like moled so go first for offline market and see that on hand
The best and the most distinctive feature is the infinity -U display which makes the phone look absolutely  stunning. The triple camera makes pictures come to reality and the ultra wide feature fits all you require  in one picture. With Samsungs Exynos 7904 processor the phone works extremely  smoothly without any worries of multitasking. I can use the phone for the entire day and the phone  will always  last because  of the 5000mAh battery which makes life so much better than just around the charger.  With the sAMOLED display  every picture  comes to life with their amazing  colours. I never have to worry about the memory  as its expandable to 512GB!
"It's not coring with  gorilla class

"As the prior reviewer states I too drove by this place a million times. My husband and I love breakfast and are always seeking the ultimate omelet . We both ordered (of course) an omelet. Mine was chorizo, cheese and green chilies and my husband's was cheese and mushroom. I must say the food was piping hot, which is always a plus for me, I like my food hot! The omelet was pretty darn good, and the hashbrowns were nice and crisp. Not my ultimate omelet but I would definitely go again."

"I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to. 

My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  

I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.

On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!"

Remember I'm not saying anything about amazon because it's the only way to buy products

If you buy 7pro and want to upgrade with exchange after months one plus will offer you like 15k
Do you think it's worth

Good product at this price by samsung
thanks dinno  appreciate it
"I VERY much enjoy this place.  The Duck sandwich has changed my life.  The brick oven gives the pizza a natural, full flavor, homemade style taste that makes you slow down and enjoy every bite!  The atmosphere, the set up, and the bar is all very welcoming and very clean.  Hard to spot when you are driving down the road.  i have been there about 10 times and i still pass it up sometimes.  Parking is not the best, and valet is not really needed, but they very much have top shelf alcohol and delicious food to boot.  Not extremely expensive either, but pricey enough to make you count your bills before you enter just so you will have enough.  Great place!"

"The ""chicken burger"" with jerk sauce was gross. It was dried out with terrible flavor. The only saving grace was that it was small, which says enough right there. As another reviewed said, it was a ground chicken patty when I was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like Johnny Rockets where I believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches. I realize I have myself to blame on that misunderstanding, but it was still a terrible sandwich."

"Awesome phone waiting for it such a long time I was about to buy 7pro but this article 7t change my mind and I wait for around 4 months for it.

CONS
LOW LIGHT PHOTOS AND VIDEOS COULD BE BETTER

NO 3.5 MM JACK
NO WIRELESS CHARGING

MY VERDICT
I am quite happy with this phone as I want to play pubg and take good picture it's a mixture of both.
I got this phone in 27k with the exchange of my OnePlus 5 so I am quite satisfied

"Amazon team,

On my behalf my brother received the product since I was out of town. Today after arriving back I opened the product n found that it is defective and there is little gap on top side of screen n back cover which is sufficient for dust or water ingress. Also saw that return window is closed yesterday. Being a prime member request you to please replace the product with new one. I assure that the product is unused. Please contact me."
"this another place that i would give no stars to if possible. 
it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.

i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.

after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.

seriously, I'm really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos, yet gross, ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?"
Under 10000 very nice phone.
"Worst phone by MI, I have already returned my phone one time nd the reason behind this are fingerprint scanner not working properly nd battery drainage.
And today i got new phone after replacement and again there are slow charging issue, heating problem nd battery drainage problem. It's a request you to all please don't waste your money for purchasing this type of worst phone."
I dint get the bill of product

I really just come to the fair if there is a concert I want to see. It is fun to walk around and see all the sights. I did like that if you got in before 6pm it was half price. More money to spend on goodies. The piggly wiggly currly cheese fries are good. Loved the kettle corn and fry bread. But you can't beat the really cheap concerts and usually every year there is one person that you are like eh 20 bucks is worth it to see them!
Rear Camera quality is not good and charging port is loose & not working properly. Every time you have to check charging level.
"Worst phone i ever bought. For this price they are plenty good phones available. For only samsung brand i bought this and made a blunder. Defective piece received. And not returned yet by Amazon. Poor service by amazon.
Learned lesson."
Worst phone.... bad picture quality...phone  Strucks often.... it takes 2 minutes to pick up a call or dial a call.....better dont buy this scrap... worst product ever from best brand company

1 - Samsung Brand Name And After Sales Support.
2 - One Ui Samsung Has The Best Ui For Smartphone And The Best Part Is That This Ui Is So Stable Compared To Other Ui(Actually Buggy Ui)
3 - Battery Is Legit

Second The Things That I Don't Like
1 - Front Camera Because it makes the images so waterry.
2 - Fingerprint and Face Recognisation is Slow
3 - I Know  Exynos Chip are Great But Samsung Is Not Making At There Highest Capable Level

CONCLUSION - Want A Phone From A Tier 1 Brand Just Buy It.
But Looking For A Hardcore Gaming and Heavy Multitasking Soory But Look Out Other Option"

"The handset which I recently picked is the Samsung M30 6+128, Gradient Blue is really awesome. It's a bunch of good features in a pocket friendly handset especially since I'm a student and I wanted to buy a phone with my pocket money. The feel is quite sturdy and it looks premium. The color is really good looking. The screen is really smooth and dose not put strain on eyes. Gaming is a quite good experience on this handset as I plan to play PUBG throughout the day and I'm sure it wont lag due to the 6gb ram. Allover I loved it. I'm so happy to make the smart choice and pick the best phone."

"I waited months before finally getting around to coming here, and it wasn't all I had hoped for. Went for my birthday, and got the garlic bread appetizer, wasn't very good and got crumbs all over the table. It had an odd burnt taste. Got the mushroom and steak calzone, which was huge and filling, but very greasy and took a long time to actually get to the table. They claimed it was the Hoagie that one of my friends had that took so long, but it shouldn't take so long to cook a sandwich. Either way, delicious, but nothing too special for the price. I won't likely return here, since some of my friends don't like this place."

Finally got the mobile in the 7th sale. Had to wait for almost a month now. Excellent mobile. It's worth wait and worth every penny. Ultrafast performance perfect for gamers. Battery is massive 2 days for normal use and would take just 2.5 hrs for full charge and camera clarity is good. Charging cable is a bit short though.

"This place was old school when it old school was in session.  I can't spot any changes since it was one of the original Cork N' Cleavers - maybe new carpet, but that may be it.

The salad bar is so old school, it still has jello - not jello shots - jello.  And since, I'm old school, I'm a fan of the salad bar.

Monday 4 buck burgers with 2.50 salad bar is the only food you'll require for the whole day.  Decent burger too.

Good barkeeps - they remember your name or call you hon (old school).

The food is pretty basic, but they start with decent ingredients and prepare them well.  Had the prime rib a couple of weeks ago and my view is that the only way to eat prime rib is to have it breath it's last on the way from the kitchen to the table.  It was early enough in the evening that they were able to deliver a tasty hunk of meat that was as requested.

If you're into modern, contempo kinds of joints, Feeney's won't be for you - but if you're in the mood for dark, old school, slightly seedy (in a good way) - then Feeney's  might just fit the bill."

"Pretty cool place that appeals to 2 very different crowds. 

My friends and I stayed downstairs for the majority of the night. The hip hop music was pretty good and the DJ had a excellent music selection. The bartenders were very friendly, except for one of the blonde girls. When I put my empty beer bottle on the bar, she took it and I raised my hand to say ""thank you"" for taking it. Then she came back with another beer that I didn't order, and I think she got a little pissed because she misunderstood me. At the end of the night, I asked for some water and she only gave me a bottle instead of just a cup of tap water and charged me $2. Don't be a hater lady!!

GET A SHOT OF CAFE PATRON!!! If you like coffee and patron, it's literally the best of both worlds. And, to top it all off, they are only $3 A SHOT!! Very reasonably priced. I had 3 within a span of an hour (I'm a heavyweight so I wouldn't recommend that for everyone!)

Upstairs, they have techno/house music and it's packed like no other. The people are really cool though. They have friendly battles and it's pretty cool to just watch them for about 10 minutes. Depending on your scene, you can pick either floor."

Battery life is awesome (I get almost 2 days with 100% charging)
Display is good.
Cannot delete many apps (as in case of other Samsung phones) you just have to disable them.
I have never had the heating problem on this phone, My old OP2 used to get heated a lot.
Camera is just OK (comparing with my old OP2).

Junk the Chinese phones and go for this. Really worth what you pay for."

"I can't believe Amazon can sell a defective one plus phone. After 1 month of usage I am already seeing lags, specially dialing and ending calls. The fingerprint scanner is often not responding. I can't believe a One Plus phone hangs so much. Please suggest on how to get the issue fixed."

"I'm basically a chain-hater (well, I dont hate them, but I try to avoid them).
Capriottis is an exception.
This delicious sandwich shop has some of the best sandwiches I've  had for the type of establishment that it is: a chain sandwich shop.
The Bobbie, which is made of freshly roasted turkey (I've seen the big hunks that didn't get chopped), cranberry sauce, stuffing and a hint of mayo is fabulous!
The capastrami is a delightful combination of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and cole slaw, and wonderful in taste.
You can choose the size of sandwich you want, as well!
Capriotti's also has salads, and a host of other sandwhich selections, which are consistently delicious and fresh.
Their personnel are very friendly, the prices are very reasonable, and it can be the best quick sandwich you've ever had...you just have to go!"

"Best phone under 20000 , but please if possible u buy a hard case for this for drop safety. Overall phone was Xtremely good . Camera is also good and micro shots are very much pretty good and 64mp camera photography fabulous.thank you redmi ."
This phone has got all the features of iphone and its performance is amazing. The 64 megapixel camera gives you vrystal clear photos. It's simply spectacular.
also game experience
"IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers.

The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy.

[update April 2, 2011]

Why'd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I should've stayed home.

My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.

My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate. 

Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)

Ok now it's three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down, she would puke. Seriously.

The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood."
Havin a much better day today!! Finished the last Twilight book yesterday. Classes start next week!      Get at me yall!!
But battery is excellent end of the day comes in 30%
GOOD PRODUCT
Awesome phone...very gd camera...big display....
And yet with the #GOPDebate it's still not the strangest thing said in the last 24 hours http://t.co/uBaUqyN12K
Costly phone compare to MI
Average product. Build quality is ok. Feeling too many Chinese app installing itself and collecting user data.
Excellent camera... Nice built quality.... little bit heavier
The phone died within a month of purchase
"just woke up, and my tummy hurts  there`s always something wrong with me :S"
"Excellent product ,battery is awesome, camera is also super value to money"
I am using A51 since a month and I the phone keeps on hanging.
Good phone in below 10k
"Bought for my brother. working just fine, does not support too much heavy gaming like PUBG, Bit of heating issue, Camera is just descent."
"i liked this phone fine until after the jan update, when it started charging at a glacial pace (~5-10% per 24 hours!!!!!!) with ALL chargers. now, i don't know what to do with it. i hope a later update fixes it."
"Worst camera quality , useless 3 rear camera
Too much heavy like a brick in your hand"
"I've been to multiple Buca di Beppo locations in several cities.  They are a good place to go with a large group.  We went to this location with a group of nine.  The menu was typical.  We ordered the seafood trio, which was nice, and the fried mozzarella, which was also good.  The Caesar's salad was also good.  We ordered pasta entree's and chicken, all of which were served up warm and in plentiful portions.  We left with a fair amount of food.  I would give the food four stars.  However, I would give the service one star.  Two in our party ordered cocktails.  Five of us ordered wine with dinner.  All drinks arrived together with our entrees.  We did not get enough dinner plates.  We did not get enough wine glasses, and had to wait for three more.  Three entrees arrived together, and we had to wait about five minutes for the fourth to arrive.  We had to ask three times for boxes to put our leftovers in.  We were never asked if we wanted dessert.  If the service were spot on, the rating would be much higher, but, I can't justify it."
Yes! You do!
Bad phone

Awesome
Camera quality is super. Redmi is getting better and better day by day. It gives us quality smartphones at economic prices.
Super performance and good camera quality.
The most liked feature of this model is the effortless camera clicks. You don't have to be a pro to click awesome pics through this model. Just point and shoot. The second best feature is the speed of the phone.
Superb battery camera ok overall good

"No words about Amazon delivery. It took a day to reach Bangalore from Chennai and 8 days to reach me from the nearest Amazon delivery centre. Great Amazon keep it up, even a turtle can beat you in this.
About the phone : I never used a phone in my lifetime like this kind of phone. Even my six year old son can draw better picture that the picture taken in this phone camera. Very Poor camera quality..
I don't want to write further. No words to describe this below standard product."
Issue of network
"Battery life better' picture nice but

It also notified to reset for video call"
Amazing one....Thanks to Samsung to provide us opportunity to be updated and Amazon to make us AMAZED every time...
"Quick response in fingerprint reader, amazing camera quality & battery life is also amazing. Thank you Redmi for such a product in our budget."
"Not work fingerprints,my last phone camera was better than this phone."
" It's a good phone within the range below 10k.
No comparison with other brands. Samsung is Samsung.
No hang. Face unlock with finger unlock options. V.good display. Best buy with Amazon offer. Got In only  in 8100"
Fingerprint scanner area is very small and fails detection many times. Camera claimed to be 64% is not worth and it's just a basic output everytime. Photos are not in natural colours and blurrs greatly when zoomed in. 7 pro is better in terms of camera. Moreover Amazon is selling refurbished phones and not giving the refund when matter is produced to customer care. They are only offering replacement that too within 10 days.

Good part:
Battery life, weight, sound quality, OS, dedicated slot for memory card, ease in using n guide populate, storage is good, auto cleaning processes run daily so memeory cleaning automatically, back camara pic quality is good

Things which i feel not upto mark:
Selfie camara picture quality even when light is proper, performance is low.. when u open browse u can see dual time flicker, when do fast type smasung keyboard hangs or showing diff characters like we r getting when do long press, while incoming call u can see transition from number to name having contact list near 300 numbers.

"The interior is very industrial and charming; furnished with iron beams, brick walls and simple hanging lightbulbs. The lobby area has special imported drinks and other trinkets. There is always a line but it usually goes pretty quick because you're distracted by all of their deserts and miscellaneous goodies on display. I've never had a meal that wasn't awesome here. I usually find myself eating the simple but delicious Liberty Joe with their special spicy sauce and then finishing the meal off with a home-made snicker-doodle. Whatever you end up ordering, I'm sure you'll end up enjoying Liberty Market as greatly and as frequently as I do!"

Battery back is not like as they said of 6000MAH. Not happy with the battery back up.
"From an allround perspective this is a beauty in all its functions and features offered. But I felt a little draining of battery when watched videos for long hours.  Anyways its preferable choice for a normal user, who is not obsessed with gaming."
Slow motion is not uploaded on tik tok and FB  very bad

"Qdoba is a kicked up version of Chipotle/Kokopellis.  You walk up, choose a form of delivery (burrito, nachos, salad, burrito bowl, etc) you get a choice of meat (chicken, steak, etc) then you chose your toppings (different salsas, lettuce, cheese).  We all know the drill.  I will say one thing Qdoba is much better in taste than Kokopellis and Chipotle."

Beautiful phone design."
"There is an issue were reported by my side. Which is ""screen not responding"" to my touch. Actually i have made a chat with one plus india team, as they have advised me to return/ replace the product.
1.Actually the phone now OK
2.At that time after updating the latest version of OS,(After 1 hr) the phone goes hung and the screen doesn't respond to my touch dont know what is the actual issue still now.
3.But the physical switches like power button, volume, silent mode and even face lock and finger print sensors are worked smoothly. Only the screen were not responds. I cant able to restart the phone also.
4.Then the one plus india team advised to remove the screen card , and i test it but no luck.
5.Then advised to press power button + volume down button (Factory data reset) till 20- 30 sec but no responding.
6.Finally i decide to go for replacement, at that time i realize  there is no replacement as becoz its out of stock(Not sure the reason).
7.For a last chance i just press Power button+ Volume up button god grace its restarted at the time and the issue cleared. But not sure which is due to the OS updation and all and don't know whether issue came again or not.

"Cheapest quality mobile by Samsung.
Network related issue if changing location frequently. Need to refresh network settings every time.
Camera quality is not meeting the expectation as Samsung advertised.
 Face recognition is not at all secure because there is no Irish scan . One can unlock your mobile when you are sleeping or by showing your photo.
Processing is slow and some application is getting struck sometimes."
"RT @RWSurferGirl: Thanks Fox News, you're raising @realDonaldTrump 's ratings. 🇺🇸 #GOPDebate  #GOPDebates"

"Best smartphone under 50k price range.
Pros.
Finishing
Quality
Looks
RAM management
Enough ROM
Flagship Processor
Camera module
Best skin UI
SuperFast charging

Cons..
Battery drain in 18hours
Atleast 4000mah is required"
As mentioned in specification. 6000 mah battery work like 3000 mah
"Oneplus has nailed it with specs, they always had a great software, the camera does it's job very well. Plus a fast charger is a bonus. The only disappointment was the battery life. For heavy users, you need to charge at least twice a day, for normal usage it will last a full day. One other small issue, is the camera bump- not sure why they designed the cameras in the circular module. If you can live with these two issues, and have a budget of around 40K, then this is a great choice."
Mobile is over heating..
"Honestly speaking, I've been using it since 6-7 months and am satisfied on using it. Its 5000 mAh battery is extremely powerful to last for 2 days on its max use. Triple rear  camera is just awesome in its budget. This device is just truly value for money."
"We came here using a groupon or living social or one of the thousands of deals now available. I can't keep track. 

We were there the day the deal expired, and I think everyone else was too! The place was packed, which was really nice. We sat at the bar and had a beer before the movie, then grabbed another to drink during the show.

The movie was SUPER interesting. Not anything I'd seek out on my own, but definitely worthwhile. I think a lot of the films here are like that.

We didn't even see the big loungy area until after the show. Bummer! I'd definitely come back and hang there before or after a movie, very neat looking.

FilmBar is definitely recommended for a fun, unique night out!"

"Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.

I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.

Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.

Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.

I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.

All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time."
Superb phone
"1)Camera's are good. But can't compare to an Ip hone XR or Iphone 11 and above. So it needs to get improved.
2) Battery is average. It would barely last for a day. But charging is fast like 0-70 in just 30mins. So that helps.
3) Display is great. 90Hz feels really smooth. Colour Accuracy is great too.
4) Software experience doesn't need to be explained. Oxygen OS is by far one of the best custom OS.
5) Performance is great. No issues. One will enjoy using this device.
6) Stereo speakers are great with great sound clarity, dolby atmos and sufficient loudness."

"Overall it is a decent phone at this price point,
Display quality is good,and a decent camera,
No such cons,although it has a 720p display but it looks good."
Very good proformance  &camera of this phone Realy Nice
Previously I used mi phones for almost 3 years.. when I made choice over Samsung I afraid of hanging issue.. but M20 proved me I was wrong.. and it worth for every penny you spent for it.. camera and battery performance is too good.. battery almost last for more than a day after moderate continues usage... Finger print sensor sometimes not working good.. that might be due to wetness of finger.. that's not a great drawback for me.. overall M20 is the best phone at this price range
Camera is not up to the mark . Amazing battery back up .
Good

"Hi Guys, I am editing my review. This is Genuine review guys.. please read before go for this mobile.

I have bought this against all my friends advise who had very bad experience with Samsung. I have been using this mobile from last 24 days.
From day 2 onwards this mobile start giving problem to me. It keeps on restarting itself for every 2 to 3 hours. After 20 days mobile stopped working. Nothing was working, it was only showing some encrypted message. Then I went to the Samsung service center and got repaired. And  I lost all my data, photos, files which I carried from my old phone. This happened just within 20 days of time. I don't know how many time I need to go to service center in future.

Guys before you buy this mobile please make sure that you have service center nearby, please do not trust this mobile, any time it may give hand, please keep file securely and have a back up.

Again Samsung proved that they can not give quality product."

"Let me preface this story with the fact that it was not my little guy who I had to take in. I am dog sitting my friend's dog. They are on vacation. Dr. Alber and his amazing staff were unbelievable. I called at 5:15. They got me in at 5:30. Dr. Alber spent 40 minutes with me. Explained everything to me thoroughly. Little Rusty just has allergies and an eye infection but it was making him miserable. Dr. Alber gave me a plan of attack to care for it. EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE. $70 out the door, RX in hand and a tube of eye drops. I am in awe. I will recommend this clinic to everyone I know. I just cannot say enough good things about these lovely people. THANK YOU PRESTIGE ANIMAL CLINIC. YOU ROCK!!!!!!! I will now be taking my own little guy there. You guys are now the only vet I will ever use."

Improvement in Sensor and touch  sometimes..
"Ye Olde Pipe has a great selection of cigars and a very big walk-in humidor, almost too big. I say that because as I walked around I came across a few boxes of cigars that were way too dry. With that said, I still found SEVERAL cigars that were fresh and moist. What I liked best about Ye Olde was the variety, they had several cigars at all price points, so if you can't afford to smoke an Opus X, they had plenty of cigars for less than $10. 

If you aren't an avid smoker, I don't know if you will get any help because the staff did not seem very friendly or welcoming, but if you know what you want, there is a good chance they have it."

"I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.

Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.

Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.

The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.

PROS:
CAMERA - 4.8/5
BATTERY- 5/5
Display - 4.7/5
Performance - 4.8/5
Speed - 5/5
Gaming experience- 4.8/5

CONS
NO Headset jack.
One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.
Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)

Overall: 4.7/5  One Plus proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it."
Very high heet in charging time and video play

The phone takes 1min to open apps.
Can't change wallpaper as it is always asking for updates even after updating.
Camera shutter takes 2sec to capture a normal image.
It's been 11 days since I got this phone but I'm facing all these issues.  I don't recommend the phone."

You might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only.

The Bikini Lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man. I mean it's in a shitty neighborhood where you might die, doesn't take credit cards, and has only bags of chips for food. So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here. Don't go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed. Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes, order pitchers of PBR until you and your friends are all sick, then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down Grand Avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money. After that, you'll get in a bike taxi/rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees, have him take you to another bar, instead of home, and then you will be further than you were to begin with. When you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money (you find this out because he has a car) and gives you a ride home. You wake up the next morning wondering why all of your cash is gone, how much you drank, and where your friends are.

If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!"
Awesome performance and camera too
"white pointy shoes haha, and ah you got me excited about the new drummer  youre mean"

Props to @megynkelly for doing a great job asking the hard hitting questions @ the #GOPDebate last night
Good
Super mobile
But I think realme phones are better than this
"Samsung you are awsome , within 10k its unbelievable,  just go for it without any doubt .
This phone is best at every stage .
No one believe that is phone is under 10 k , even one user of s10 plus ."
got 1 after school detention. 2 lunch times and if i dont go to them. i will get 2 more after schools
just got a wii
"Mobile phone is not getting on after unboxing. Even after 70% charging it's not getting on.
It is showing reboot options on pressing power button which is abnormal. I think it's faulty product. Poor quality. Need to return this bad product."
As the battery life is very long and also have a fast charger so the battery gets fully charged very fast but the camera quality is just satisfactory if you are looking for a camera quality smartphone buy realme 5 but you are looking for a gaming phone but this vivo u10
"Worst model of Samsung.
Some phones are coming with inbuilt touch screen issues.
Refund not possible.
Worst customer service by Amazon.
Tough replacement options are there but it's only for 10 days.
Service centers are providing worst service, they don't know how to repair this perticular handset.
Hanging problems will apear in few days.
Overheating is a day to day issue.
Wide angle camera doesn't meet expectations.
Battery backup is good."
Good camera quality and battery life
"Horrible camera, performance lag despite SD 600+ series Chipset.
Better competitive options available at this price range."
My Samsung Galaxy M20 looks very classy in charcoal black. The phone’s battery life is really good and the camera quality is amazing. The phone looks very smart as the display screen is big. It is very sleek and using it is a lot of fun. The phone is very fast and i love using it.
Until now its one of the best mobiles I've used...lets see whether the battery backup remains the same or not after regular usage...
"It's awesome and best phone till date with very less price compare to other phone and maximum features , more than other phone"
"It's been a month & I am quite satisfied with the performance, speed , battery back up & Camera"

........ Lala.. Little girl! I love these new songs!   Iï¿½ve answered u ^^ Love to all you freaky twitter guys ;D
Camera overall good. Battery is good.
"Woke Up,I Wanna Stay In My bed"
Phone is undoubtedly awesome.... Premium feeling and next level of smoothness..
"RT @Popehat: #GOPDebates Paul: ""I want to collect more records from terrorists and fewer from Americans."""
The camera is installed above the backside phone surface body. It unbalance slightly when we place the phone on the table. Because the phone's body is not a plane.
Superb quality

Have received the product  but regret to state that there is no  headset in the  pack.  While ordering the  it was  mentioned in the descition with head set.  please check the  pick.
Worst experience....I guess all the other reviews are either paid or fake
Another noticeable thing is that the search for Tata and Airtel brands was mostly related to ` broadband connections ' .
Good
"I recommend making OpenTable reservations, as this place is small. 
I had a great dining experience and I enjoyed the drinks and food. Margaret (sp) was a great server.

I like to dine at local places like this, particularly those that make their drink mixes in house and use locally sourced food [when possible].

The drinks I had were great: Aloe Arizona, The Kingston Rum Punch and Piña Colada Redux

I had a dish with red snapper and vegetables; which was excellent. I had rice and peas on the side, the rice was not the best however; it seemed too dry.
My friend had the prawns, I did not taste it, but the presentation looked good. She also had the coconut water which was served in a coconut - it was great and she mentioned it complimented the prawn dish.

For desert I had a Créme Brûlée made with pineapple and rum."
It's an good smartphone
Used first time a stock Android phone on MI phones. Loved it
"I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.

I'll tell you ""Why NOT""... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.

That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.

Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!

It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced ""gourmet"" pizza joint.

If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc."
"Awsome phone with ultimate processor and very good camera. Battery is good too it runs along a day. The only thing which lacks in it is an amoled display, if it would be having an amoled display then its battery might run longer than current time. Anyways happy to have this device.
Happy Customer😊"
"There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.

The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what ""vegan"" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.

The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own."
Amaging phone.
just had the most emo moment too many tears love my family and sorors
Simply Go for it I have Purchased This for my Wife 😉 she Dmn happy. ❤️
👌👌
"The phone Is amazing,I was an iPhone user who switched to one plus,I found one plus 7t was a really great choice.
Pros:-
Camera quality awesome
Dolby Atmos is mind-blowing
90hz display is really great
Blue finish on the back is premium overall phone,looks really premium
Warp charge is really nice
Nice battery backup
No heating detected so far
Cons:-
One plus switch not working on IOS
Overall review :- 9.3/10"
"Best burger I've ever had, and a great view from the patio.  Enjoyed a wonderful date with my husband there."
"Being a big Fan of One plus, this disappointed me alot when i changed it with One plus 5T to 7T.  The performance wise i doesnt feel much difference despite of having upgraded OS. Camera is way much better due to change in lens. The most disappointed thing in this phone is battery. I have to charge it minimum two times for a use of least 14 to 15 hours. Atleast they have to upgrade the software to be feasible with 3800 Mah battery. Looks are good having a circular lens on the side."

Soooooooooo glad to learn that Farrells ice cream parlor is staging a comeback in So. Cal -- too bad it`s in the Mission Viejo mall
"This is the best venue in the valley for what is intended to be; a midsize venue that attracts national touring acts, with a standing room only intimacy that you won't get at a place bigger or smaller. I saw Clutch here recently, and it rocked my balls off. I didn't drink at the place (took care of that before and after) so I can't comment on drink prices. Parking did suck, but there was a structure across the street for five bucks. One downside, going to the website to check out upcoming shows is tedious. The calendar is soooo hard to sort through, I would only go there to get more info on opening bands not listed on ticketmaster.com"
"@megynkelly Why were there absolutely no questions on the jobs or economy? @FoxNews that's what is polling the highest, right? #GOPDebates"
Camera quality is not good as it tells 48MP it's not good as 16MP of other mobile
Very bad products hanging problem
"_skies You got me singing Falling in Love now. Only, I`m changing the week day to Saturday. Doesn`t quite fit."
Very poor performance
This stock android device is more than enough to power you through most of the activities.
I loved the phone. Features are very nice.price is good. Only the fact it's not easily available.
I have never had a bad experience with Xiaomi however there are some useless uninstallable apps and MIUI is filled with adverts everywhere so it's kinda annoying... Also I noticed that it hangs every now and then when using the recent apps tab.... Looks are awesome btw.... Pubg works fine... And the camera though not phenomenal but still does the job... Oh FHD screen looks good too. EDIT: after using it for a month I can say that it hangs a lot more but is still a value for money
Good one... camera quality is not upto the mark.. all the features are good...im amazed with the battery life..Best one in this range of mobiles'...Cheers
Good Quality
Very good phone describe. Camera test and battery life good
Camera quality is very poor as compared to 7 series
Overall Good performance...fingerprint sensor amoled display everything work fine...
not bad
Average Phone ..
There is room for improvement. Price is affordable but at the cost of poor quality camera .Lightning sale will lose trust in the brand.Try to sell in much more organized way.
"Heating problem,  camera quality is poor, Don't buy, wastage of money"
BEST PHONE UNDER 40000
"simply superb ...  premium look..

"This mobile has world third class network section..It has also very bad connectivity both wifi and network section.Its 5 ghz connectivity has very poor distance capacity.So I have sold the mobile only 10000.Though it has replacement policy but there is no option for refund.I have ordered another unit but that has also same problem.Don,t buy Samsung m30s.And also don't say about its build quality."
Not that great compare to his opponent
"One of the best mobile compared to other brand mobile. OnePlus 7t looks a lot like it's predecessor from the front, the rear is all new. We have a huge circular camera bump, this is huge departure from OnePlus previous version designs and we have mixed feelings about it."
"To much over heat, even when ph is lock and kept ideal it is worm.......? And very costly services if I r screen get damaged by water. Other company @ same price offer water resistance."
"thinking of getting new dvds, csi.  can`t wait to get my laptop."
I like the camera. Battery backup is average. Sound quality is pretty good. Network may let you struggling sometime. Overall average phone in this price range. Samsung needs to improve in this segment.
i like battery and mibile body look
I'm very sad this phone one letter type a more enter words
Awesome phone
The best real vivo u10
Camera is working out of box...And battery is good enough to spare 2 days if u use it on moderate way....
Bad product mobile swtich off directly will using cell.bad phone i sen ever in my life ..bad experience  poor quality
"This mobile is of excellent look,display,  but system apps occupying much memory"
"For the past ten years (ever since FunSports occupied the same unit), this place has been the one-stop shop for my biking needs.  From BMX at age 13 to road cycling in adulthood, SMC usually has what I'm looking for.  The prices don't really compete with larger chains like Performance, but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference.  When I was getting into road cycling, the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection, fit, and pricing.  A+!"
Ok
Very bad product
"More like 3.67 stars, rounding up to 4, but not any more than that which would bump it up to 5. 

Yet.

Let me explain.

1) Rose & Crown - The Hours. If it is really meant to be a British pub and a new asset to downtown nightlife, it needs to strongly declare A) YES! WE ARE OPEN! and B) YES! WE ARE OPEN *LATE*! When you're turned away when you excitedly show up at midnight on a Saturday because they decided to close for whatever reason, you're not going to be too excited about trying to go back the next time. What's a British pub doing closing so early? I went out of my way to go here, to experience this new bar and enjoy its offerings, and was sent packing. Meh. So I was surprised when a bunch of Yelpers decided to make it a meetup spot a few weeks later. Well, maybe this time, at 10:30, we'd be more fortunate with it staying open. 

And we were. Rock on.

2) Rose & Crown - The Setting. I gather that the business owners are extremely limited with how much they can change with the house since it's probably a landmark with stringent regulations on how much of the interior can be changed, but since I've eaten at Circa 1900 a number of times before it vacated the premises, walking in here felt exactly the same. Sitting at the EXACT same 4-top table I ate before. The room hadn't changed one iota when it came to layout or furniture. Even the angles the tables were placed at. That was a little odd. The only main changes in the front west room were the giant visages of the Queen and good ol' Winston glaring down at you. In any case, it was kind of hard for me to make the mental transition from ""this is a sit-down restaurant"" to a ""this is going to be your local English pub"" when it comes to the indoors. Was it nice? Definitely. It's really nice inside. But pubby? No. That said, the front balcony is a really great location to hang out on, and I can imagine how great it'll be around springtime. But the balcony's more an asset of the great old house itself. 

3) Rose & Crown - The offerings. Standard selection of beers, including good ol' English standbys like Newcastle and Boddingtons on tap. Food menu not too big, but I thought the fish & chips looked appetizing, so I ordered those. I was skeptical, but to my surprise, the fish was great, as was their spin on the tartar sauce. Fries were also tasty, but fries are fries, and I'm going to devour them anyway because I was crazy hungry. But all in all, thumbs up on the food.

4) Rose & Crown - The service. Was kind of there but more present at the beginning and then invisible near the end when were ready to leave, thus having to go back inside, tell the bar manager what we ordered since he didn't have the bill, and then pay him instead of our server. Kind of odd.

So all in all, as I said already, 3.67 stars. I'm definitely willing to go back there and be open to editing my review and increasing its star wattage, but for now, it hasn't completely won me over. Definitely has a lot of promise, with its abundance of Britpop playing and proximity to Bianco, the sporting venues, ASU, etc., but they need to work on being consistently open late before I think about making this one of my definite go-to institutions."
"Hi guys, M30🔥the best budget phone from SAMSUNG The main plus points are SAMLED display, Triple camera, nd the 5000mah battery.... now it comes with the new ONE UI built on android pie so its look good... nd the fingerprint reader(sensor) was really fast nd very secure... the Triple camera gives osm pic in wide angle nd in normal mode its also brings the best pic.... nd it is not a gaming mobile bt it performs really good I'm playing pubg mobile nd asphalt 9 nd some games in high settings nd the batteries that gives the osm battery life once you charged 100% we can play pubg continuously for 8hrs nd the battery withstands for 2dys 48hrs so if ur searching for the budget phone with a good brand then the SAMSUNG M30 is here for you M30🔥"

Overall the phone is good for it's price. Battery life and camera is good. The only problem is with inbuilt apps and the messages that keep popping up on screen because of it. Oppo should get rid of the pop us due to inbuilt apps etc.
Phone is not getting on once battery got drained.... Return window has been closed ... Pls suggest what to do...
Nice one
Camera not good
Best Camera and Best OS
"Fingerprint reader is working awesome ,camera is perfact is always one plus is master in his work... Battery is 3800 mah it's drain in one day moderate use but if u use much then it's drain within 12-14  hours.. but don't worry it's charger is from another world fastest till the date"

"I was taken here while visiting from Chicago and had one of the best margaritas of my life.  I tried the house (on ice with salt) and it was fantastic, but what I couldn't get enough of was the strawberry-lime one.  I couldn't taste a drop of alcohol...and that's when you know you have a good mixed drink on your hands. I honestly could have had three more it was so tasty, but my childlike tolerance for boozin did not allow it.  

The bartender was super nice and friendly, we had many refills of the chips and salsa (damn you, I can never resist), and it was all in a southwestern chill environment.  Supposedly the tacos are top-notch, I will have to give them a whirl next time I'm in town.  

I highly suggest going here for a happy hour or dinner."
"This is the best phone with s.amoled of this prise category, responsive fast fingerprint best camera of this price & battery life as well ."

"Outotec said it won new orders worth 492.9 mln eur during the quarter , compared with 240.4 mln eur a year earlier ."
Its normal as other phones. Not a different feature.
Overall mobile is average. Fingerprint works very fast and battery life is awesome. When it comes to camera its below average. Not 48mp it works like 12mp. And another major issue is network issue. Even though I'm in same place it will start with 4g then suddenly it will go to 2g. Then again I have to on flight mode and off. Then again it will come to 4g. Please fix this.
Great and recommeded

"Worst phone series ever by Samsung. Phone hangs alot. Touch doesn't work sometimes. I am facing issues at the same time when I am writing this. Camera is not as good J series also. Only good thing is BATTERY.
Face Id: opens with photo too
Fingerpring Id: works in multiple attempts
Camera: wide angle is adding two image from 2 cameras. Half images stays straight, half goes bended.
Battery : No doubt its 5000 mAh so works good but not best.
Charging: Fast charge is a myth for this phone.
Screen: you can hardly read anything in Sunlight.
Processor: I don't know why Samsung teied Exynos, snapdragon and kirin are much much faster than this.
Touch: Touch stops working and suddenly performs all action which you do when it stops working.
Most Important, PUBG: Dont even think to play Pubg with this. I stopped playing pubg on this phone at the end. Hangs a lot. Heats after 1 game.
Network: internet works good only when on Wifi. Tried in different places with different networks.

Only pros is Battery time. You can buy other phones in the same budget which are many times better than this."
im so jealous! I want to go to ny
Camera is very nice product is also and battery backup is also good i can view many movies in single charges.

Good phone at this price.
Camera quality is superb ....battery life is very good...Best phone in this budget...
"It is the best budget phone
It has best picture quality and the Samsung is also known for the best screen quality as all know.
For the sound quality is nice but the Dolby effects are awesome
What can I say about battery life it is almost unbelievable.In standby mode it go for a 2 and half days and the dash charger of 15 w how can we forget about that
About camera I will say not the best but above the average.but I m impress by the front camera and best thing is that wide angle lense work properly
I m using this phone for about 7 days and till now I had not seen any lag on the phone and the gaming experience is best in this phone.And I m using 3 GB variant then also the experience is best than the 4 GB variant will be awesome"
Nice product
Battery life could be better at this price. Camera quality is good.

"Average Camera quality, not met expectations like A1"
Excellent
"I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!"
"Worst camera quality.
Low sound.
Processing dam slow.
Hang problem.
Screen shaking issue.no notification LED.
Battery charging takes 4-5 hours for 100% I don't understand how they are saying fast charger facility.
Performance lacking while using multiple apps together.Bricghtness reduces randdomly even if using any app.
Overall it's a Worst product.
Samsung making fool to people's."
"Awesome product...jhakkas....all features superb...display, battery, performance,camera...go get it...."

Oppo F15 is very smart and valuable. Every thing is better uptill......i am using this from  a week till date itz very better at all sides but in future i  hope do good and better than all.....
"Long battery life, camera quality is also good, gaming experience is cool."
Average not worth for the name of Samsung
Hang several times
Writing this review after using the phone for some time... I would suggest to go for MI phones as u can get much better option at this price. The phone hangs a lot and finger sensor is also unresponsive most of the times. Camera is also average.

I have purchased Redmi note8 gamma green 6/128 gb on 29/02/2020. Now I realized that the vibration mode is not working in it. Please reply positively.
The phone is very bad.Fingerprint reader is very slow and face lock is also very slow. Camera quality is very bad. It  makes oily skin always.TO much hanging problem.

"I bought it on 9 jan 2020
Excellent mobile in affordable price. Camera quality is good."
Great phone in this price
I tried to get redmi note 8 pro but on sale date it comes sold out... whenever I trying to get from mi store and Amazon it's showing sold out only finally yesterday I got mi a3 I'm not comfortable with this handset..  i thought this badget mobile phone is awesome camera features but really waste... Display is also not good
Awesome phone....Ram management is sooo good... 📷 picture quality is very good. Processor is good handle multi tasking... Charger is good and fast charging....
Third class product and Amazon is a cheeter. Amazon will not refund you. Ur money will be lost. Customer care people of Amazon is also very bad. Very disappointed from this purchase. Don't buy mobile phone from Amazon if you don't want to be fool.

"After installation all applications,  working performance is poor,  suddenly hanging.
I am doing work or watching some movies suddenly restart."

"I m not satisfied with this product and I m not expect these kind of product quality from Samsung... I odered this phone on 14 Feb 2019 and receive the same on 18 Feb 2019 and facing on the first day and the issues are...
1. Sim slot not perfect the sim not fit properly on sim slot....
2. Network issue...... all the time the call disconnected.....
3. Touch not working properly sometime it is so fast sometimes hang....

So I m not recommend any one to buy this..."
"It's an ok phone for the price, but nothing great. Looks good though."
"Phone is little bit slow. Reat all is ok.
Little heating issue is there. But it is very nominal. Network problem also i noticed. Same sim I am using on my Iphone it showes tower 3/4, but on this phone network bar always showes 1/2. What problem, I don't know."
"Great ambiance (though a tad noisy), food, service and views. For our meals, we got the following:

[Amuse bouche]
I forgot what it was exactly, but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp. Tasty and a nice introduction, although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks.

[Appetizer]
Bread with 3 dips - The pepper pesto was hands down the winner, and the other two aren't worth mentioning.
Butter lettuce salad - Decent, but a little too sweet for me.
Lobster bisque - Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor.

[Entree]
Halibut - Best dish in recent memory! Get this. Just do it.
Roasted cauliflower risotto - Came with very tender pieces of beef. The risotto was cooked well, but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy.

[Dessert]
Espresso cup - The ice cream was delicious. The rest of it was okay.

After dinner, we took a trip outside to take in the view. We also explored the surroundings around the entrance, but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster. Oh well!

The service was great, from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable, to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine, to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert. Two thumbs up!

Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dine/drink outside. Woohoo!"
"Picture quality good,nice camera,looking good awesome...premium buget mobile 13k and Samsung product..."
"camera is average..wide agle is good.
Battery is 5000 mah but no use it drains fast. Heating issues..
performance is very bad. phone stucks. finger print is very slow.
Over all worst phone"
Worst experience.  Don't go for this. Features are for on record only
best phone at this range...
"Yesterday only brought this phone amazing experience amazing quality product thanks to OnePlus Team.
Flagship of the year"
"This phone is hang so much, and suddenly the network goes and comes after 30 or 45 seconds. Many apps like whatsapp, facebook etc are showing wait to respond error. Not expected from Xiaomi. Disappointed with this product."
Camera quality is vry bad
I have just got this phone and have very nice experience with this earlier but slowly it's mouthpiece sounds going down. This item feels like refurbished...
exllent Work No hang nd no bug with playing pubg nd free filre
Best mi phone and undated version
"You can play games continuously for more than 4 hours, can watch vedio till 9-10 hoùrs . Its a handý phone , it does not hangs , and has a grip."
It was perfect
"Very good mobile under this budget,
Strong battery life, processor very strong, average camera quality...overall this phone is great. Thank you Samsung"
don`t remind me.. Was supposed 2 meet up with the Homie  2 4 that show..  Ack! So kill it please..do the **** thang!
"My review is based on Terminal 3, Delta!  Getting checked in at Delta was quick, security line was quick, and returning picking up my bags was quick too!  The signs are easy to read and easy to understand.  I was in Nassau, Bahamas' airport, the signs pointed everywhere!  Crazy!!"

Front camera is worst. Back camera doesn't look like 48megapixel. Normal Hitting problem when play PUBG. Battery backup awesome.
There is a slight hanging issue all of a sudden the phone gets hang rest all good if Samsung come up with a solution for this it will be good

Good luck
Goodnight.
"Nyc in this budget great job by samsung display is much beautiful ur getting s8 at this price range.

"Heats up quickly, clicking photos sometimes hangs"
Worst experience with vivo ever. Cell phone getting hang a lot. Sometimes I think O made a mistake in choosing the product.😟🙄😕🤐
Fingerprint reader is slow and not working promptly. Face recognition doesn't work.

I used this from 1 month approx but after second update which is 1march security update...my phone is hanging again and again...to work properly i should unlock the phone again and again....plz fix it asap....
"Good looks , good battery lasts 1.5 days , fast charging , high resolution camera , face recognition is very convenient.
Overall a good package"
"Very poor screen,don't buty.go for realme.
Even 6000 mobile has better screen than this."
Best latte ever!!!  I missed my local coffee shop in Phoenix and I stumbled upon Echo.  I am so happy I found this place.  Free Wi-fi and AMAZING lattes have won me over!  I recommend the Turkey & Brie sandwich.  The pear made the sandwich.  They have a great music selection and they don't crank up the volume.  Check this place out!
It's like Paradise Bakery but with a more diverse and far better menu.
"Good,"
 Second hand material used in new device.. I try to install app its showing interface of other user.. That means its hardware used from  other device and install in it.. May be second material used in this device..
: no i`m not going.
Mobile battery backup is very bad
Eveey time i open the lock screen it shows irritating ads
"Camera quality is really good, but if I receive a call then Internet stops working and I've to disconnect and connect to wifi again."
"Bad Camera quality. Camera is not suitable for photography. Camera focus is not clear and smooth.
After one month fingerprint reader not working."
"#Battery backup is good
# In starting shows low battery but after updation no problem

"Except finger print Reader
The phone is awesome
Camera settings are little bit complicated but quality is excellent
Battery super"
"Figerprint sensor is good, just miss sometimes to recognize. Camera quality is awsome. But the major disappointment is the battery life. There is 6000 mAH battery, but the backup is not telling the same rating. It seems like battery is 3500 or 4000. Screen is good. Overall ok phone. One can go for it."
"The first question which strikes a common man is what makes this 38k phone different from other phones ranging under 20k. So I've been a Xiaomi user from starting. Under exchange offer I've exchanged Redmi 6 pro with this 7T. This phone has the uttermost best camera you could ever think off. Even in night it takes the best classy pics for you. The performace of this phone is amazing and is upto the mark. Overall you can also use it for vloging as I will be and it shoots the best video for you. Overall it serves all your purpose of GoPro cum DSLR.
P.S: It serves the purpose. Individually GoPro and DSLR are better than 7T. But if you are looking for a complete pack in one go for 7T without any doubt."
The best product for it's value. It's performance speaks it all........use it...... experience it.....NEVER SETTLE

"It's not even a month since I ordered this phone, and it hangs so much.
I am really sick of it. I did not expect such kind if service from amazon."
I've been hearing good things about this coffee house in Cave Creek so when a friend suggested we meet there I was all for it. Easy to see furniture store Big Bronco and Janey's is behind it. Very good coffee and I'll come back to try the food.  Comfortable place to just hang out.
excellent phone with excellent features but NO NFC AVAILABLE IN THIS MODEL
"Don't buy this product in Amazon, display become yellow colour scheme failed to perform. Disappointed buying this product at here. Waste of money and time. No idea whether it's made by Samsung or not?"
Receiver volume is very less  unable to hear properly during calls  processing time also more  I think this mobile is more focused for camera leaving basic requirements
"All features is average as 15000 , but if this features with mobiles came rate is 13000 so good samsung are give average features costly compair other companies mobile"""
"If you are planning to buy this phone for playing PUBG so it's good for this game
Overall good phone."
Touch screen is responding very slowly..also hanging problem.. not that much good in this price.. I will suggest to go with another brand..
"Damn good pizza! A little spendy (hence why I didnt give them 5 stars) for what you get but regardless, the pizza is pretty damn good. The wings are decent, I think there baked instead of fried and the sauce seems a little weak. They often have a 25 dollar special which includes 20 wings and a large pizza or some kind of 2 pizza wing combo for around 40 dollars. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for some family fun times surrounded with fun people and good food."
"The phone is great in all aspect, only one issue I am having, as I use starmaker app, it's hard to comment on songs as textbox are not appear peoperly, and even I can't comment in Party rooms, no text box, rest all phone has it, only Samsung doesn't have it, fix this software issue, otherwise we need to focus on other phones just because of this tiny issue...and one thing, I can't see, if someone mentioned me in starmaker in comment or in song..."
Best product value for money but cemera is not very good like 64 MP
"Camera quality is not that good , fingerprint reader doesn't work properly"
but my bday is JUNE 19.. this is wack... and ihavent seen any promotions for my bday party  someone better finagle this asap!
"I woke up with a sore throat  Work tonight. Grad practice in the morning, hanging with family, then GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL"
"I m using 6gb/128gb version for last few months. Review can be parted in following heading.
1. Display- one of the best in this price range. Very vibrant colours combination.
2. Battery- it's huge advantage to have battery of this size, no matter how heavily u use it, it will never disappoint u for whole day. Normal user will get more than one day backup.
3. Speed- u can not match it with apple or other high end phone, but in this range u can't  have better than this. Simply one of the best in this bracket.
Camera- will not disappoint u. One of the best in distance and close shots.
Sound- quality could have been better, though loaded with Dolby atmos. This can be overcome by using a good earphone as it's not supplied with phone.
Overall- it's body has metal finish, which gives rich feel, but it doesn't matter much as people are using back cover."
Mobile not switched on after some days
I`m saying my goodbye to my car for the next 2 weeks  I`m gonna miss it!!  Its going to come back beautiful though!!
"1st day: After unpacking, installing few apps and the phone is already heating up.
2nd day: started showing network issues and battery draining issue as well.
Do not choose this phone."

"Have you ever walked into a bar or restaurant and instantly felt at home?  That's how I felt when I walked into the Grind last night.  The place has a great vibe, fantastic food and cocktails, and a friendly staff.  Some of the highlights of what we ate last night...  The burgers are phenomenal, the cable car drink was unusual and tasty, how could you not love donuts, and the bacon... oh the bacon...  I highly recommend swinging in for lunch or dinner so it become one of your favorites as it is now one of mine."
Is looking forward to a yummy dinner with mizz Kate jones this evening!
"Very cute, pretty good sandwich and coffee.  This is a pretty good place to stop in between shopping sprees.  They have really good/healthy sandwiches and good coffee drinks.  

*Service = really fast and nice
*Food = good and healthy
*Atmosphere = relaxing and cute
*Brownie = yummy :)"
Very good phone in comparison of mi @ best price
Batrery is good. But rear camera is not up to the mark. Vedio calling is also of poor quality. Better to go for A50 or A50s.
" Touch complaint within a week. Replacement window more if you buy from Samsung store(14days). Date of purchase is considered(not date of delivery) when you purchase from Amazon(10days). So I didn't get replacement .
Repaired display under Samsung warranty,
Battery and camera not as expected.
Product not better than a chinese phone."
"Awesome spec..and on hand feeling...
I used it since 2 month and still its performance is brilliant...
Just go for it..."
"Everything about the phone is great , it has cool features with makes it very satisfying.  Its been 2 months and I am still on this phone as its features and qualities makes me love it. Its 4GB Ram and its Exynos 7904 processor make Gaming experience so good I play both Mobile Legends and PUBG and the gaming is still great no lags, no interruptions very smooth, it's a great phone for gamers as it has got great battery life and it also changes real quick. The figureprint sensor are of great quality and it's very smooth and quick, it comes with another option to unlock the phone that is face identification which makes it easy for users to unlock their phone but the Face ID does not work at night. The camera of the phone are amazing the triple camera makes every pic so beautiful it's great for videography the videos that I took are quite steady and the front camera really enhances your every pic , it also come with many camera features with is really fun like the stickers and the live focus feature.  The battery life is amazing it takes least time to charge and has a long battery life I usually charge my phone once or twice a day, I am a gamer and the battery life really impressed me. The perfect phone with a low price , all the features that I need and I had it delivered in just one week thanks to Amazon. I like all the thing about this phone but It would have been better if the speaker was a bit louder and I wish it came with a phone case like Realme and earpiece. But really a satisfying phone and after the recent update my phone looks and feels really great. Satisfaction loaded ."
Still a fan. I'm incredibly impressed one of the staff even remembered my name and my last purchase on a return visit.
Best phone under this price range
"Mobile has big hunging problem even network is not good. Many times voice quality become very poor and many times keypad is not works
I m big fan of Samsung but this series is not good.
After using more than 10 days...mobile"
Within six month the screen got damaged.
"All over Phone its Awesome
don't buy apple plz buy this phone
only one problem
In This phone has't Been No Earphones plugged
so I can Buy Bluetooth or C Type"
If yo are going for Android One then STOP and do go in reverse direction. The worst nightmare for them who need regular bug free updates. Lots of lies told by the MI Manu jee. So be careful before buying it. I am think to get rid of this.
"Detail:-
- Fast Phone, Good Display
- Wide Angle camera produce very soft images.
- Macro is very good"
Best Best Best 1
"It's an awesome phone loved it totally camera quality is super clicks pic naturally ,battery life is really good,the only thing I did not get is sometimes even if the phone is fully charged it automatically gets switched off."

"RT @kwrcrow: Dr. Carson remark on DC having half a brain, best line #GOPDebates."
"100% satisfaction with this phone thus far! Love the design, the performance, Oxygen OS, it's a whole lot better than what my previous phone in Samsung was. Doesn't heat up at all, never lags or hangs.

With that being said it's early days I'm hoping it stands the test of time and it's only been about a month of usage, but thus far I'm loving every second of it.

Battery usage lasts for between 8 and half to 10 hours of screen on time usage and generally lasts for the 24 hours for a heavy user like me. Generally charges from nearly empty to a 100 in a little less than an hour. Charges to 90 in about 50 minutes and to 70 in little over half an hour.

Not a huge camera user but from what I have used of it I'm satisfied with it. Phones like Pixel would obviously be better in that department but it wouldn't let you down. This is probably the only area where it's not flagship level. Otherwise it feels premium in almost every other way."
"Plzz don't buy this phn. This phn have a battery issue. If used 4 to 5 hours it will get heated. The phn systems are not user-friendly too..
Plzzz for God sake don't buy this phn for it carema quality  because camera quality is good.. else everything is bad unmanageable."

Dont suggest this phone for extensuve users and gamers"
Camera quality is not so good and the colours are very sharp.
Come See Me Live On Stickam  http://www.stickam.com/valentine_rock
Nice
Battery and camera are simply awesome
I bought this phone at 13.5k rupees and at this price tag the phone pretty much satisfies my needs. With medium usage and 4g turned on continuously the battery is still 31% left since its last charge about 35 hours back. I could also feel low radiation  due its low sar value. Camera is good but not great. But I am fine with it.
"This place is great to go to for a chill and low key atmosphere.

You can play billiards, cornhole, or video blackjack. 

One thing I didn't like: one of the bartenders told me there is a $10 minimum to use my credit card and I think he was trying to hustle me because when I went back to close my tab (without buying another drink), the other bartender took my credit card.

Otherwise, a nice chill place to go."

Phone has multiple functional defects.

Camera quality is the best.. Battery life is also best for using.. fingerprint reader is also best and smooth by only just touching only the mobile unlocks..

I so lucky I got this phone on First sale with 10% discount. After using more than 3 weeks, I didn't find any issue. Battery backup is awesome, I usually charge only one time in day. after heavy use of internet, gaming like PUBG, call of duty, videos and watching online movies, still Battery backup good. Liquid cooling technology is good, after playing PUBG continually more than 2 hours, mobile little bit heat. but just rest of 3 or  5 minute, mobile get cool. Overall this phone is awesome which give separate nano sim support means we can insert two sim in different slot."
Recieved defective product.. Neither samsung repairing it..
"My trip was inspired by Adam Richmond's visit and while I couldn't do the 12 slider challenge, I knocked out 5 and was close to taking on a 6th.

"Brand spankin' new...customer service with a smile.

Good selection, good prices, friendly customer service. Bought some stuff to make the house better - garage door opener, some hooks to finally hang that darn 65 x 78 painting up...

Nothing at all like Home Depot, either. I found the fixtures for kitchen improvements here to be of higher quality as well.

Thumbs up from me...plus, it's so close to the house - not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. Time will tell."
"I bought this phone 363 days ago. Like all Samsung phones I have so far used, they seem to go phut in exactly one year or just before the year ends. And the service centers are always out to devise new excuses to deny your warranty or delay it till the year ends and then they throw up their hands. Never buy Samsung phones."
"Please ....Do not buy
Totally west of money"
Camera is ok. Finger print reader is not good . But the worst is it does not connect 4g always gives H+ icon at the top. It hardly connects to 4G and the internet speed is also very slow
@SpeakerBoehner You too lie Mr. Speaker that's why we like @realDonaldTrump @RealBenCarson and @CarlyFiorina #GOPDebate
I thought Samsung came up with one UI with solved all the down side of their previous Touchwiz UI. But I was wrong... Now I just hate it.. 😠..battery performance  and backup is good... Still exynos  processor  is garbage.. Don't expect  any major  gaming at all. Display is Crisp although  it's not AMOLED but TFT panel.. Camera is somewhere average. I say put some. Extra bucks and get m30 s.... It's far more better Then this m20.
I bought this a month ago. After some days i found dust inside camera lens. I tried to contact Amazon.. Mi.. No one is going to replace this after they falied to clean the dust for 4th time in a row. I am suffering because of that. And i know they can't resolve my issue. So may be i have to throw it to dustbin and go on.
"The staff is great, the food is great, even the cappuccino is great (had my first one today).

i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and it's very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch.

A few of my favs are:

- Chicken Salad Sandwich
- Southwest Ranch Salad
- Omelets

Enjoy! (maybe I'll run into you there)"
Good product
"Let's talk about failure, baby.

Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!

I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  

This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.

I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for."
Battery was not good
"Performance, camara and look - ALL great. True value for money."
Na
Totally a new version of Samsung... samsung m30 which is better than what i have expected with a powerful 5000mah battery... and the fingerprint sensor is working amazingly... and one of the smartphone with triple camera but the rear camera lacks a bit quality and the front cam running smoothly with 16mp cam and its new design is awesome... and the fingerprint scanner is competitive with the other smartphones... and one of the best midrange smartphone with amazing features... the most amazing feature is its battery backup and fingerprint scanner
worst camera quality and donot expect this from Samsung
Camera is good
This is amazing smartphone under 15k category...I'm purchase this mobile twise time...

Some Add-ons

Battery backup with compare of performance 1 day with gaming and videos.
Warranty - every Mi services will accept and they have to accept with Amazon and Flipkart bill as these are their official online sale partner

Device setup- After using all Android UI personaly I found MIUI has smooth and user friendly interface."
Nice
Good product
Best part is the Battery with the bright  amoled screen which consume very low power gives me a full day charge with reminder about 20 percent. New OS was little bit slow but its now fine after new update.  Wide angle camera is amazing. The finger print censor is quite slow. Face scanner is faster then i thought. All over I am satisfied with this phone at this price point.
Worst camera ever in samsung phone
"First of all phones battery is fabulous no dislike for battery but if we talk about sensor only sensor rotation is the best sensor but camera's  quality isn't that much goood as much as I'd expected from samsung , if we talk about fingerprint reader my phone's reader isn't working right now ,"
Really good design and speed is too good.
Screen is just so beautiful and fluid. Want to just keep looking at it. Battery drains faster than my op5 but charges even faster. Gaming is awesome and sound quality is out of world. Camera is ok with different modes.
Good phone. Bt like Motorola &  Nokia Android One phones is not well optimised. Such as HD voice notification shade always shows on the notification shade. Battery !! Definitely not 4000mh
"Really Unstoppable performance, in every aspect.
Battery super,
Supper Fast processor,
Display good,
sound good.
Gaming mode,
Pubg mobile @ 9990"
Everything is fine in the phone
"The phone is best for gaming,  I hve a 8/128 config, most graphic games are running smooth like butter, the phone gets heated while in the game, but gets cooled off immediately once u are in the lobby, due to the liquid cooling.....not happy with the camera array thou......battery life is good as it is new, the charging and discharging will take a toll in time.....
My verdict is go for it for current period as there is no other phone in this range as good as this."
Best product with ok specs...
Worth of money
Overall quality best in this range price
ohh **** i just realized she still not talking to me  it b like dat some times..
Not worth the price pay little more for other brand and get much better than this phone

Samsung galaxy m30 is the best midrange phone of samsung. It comes with really amazing featues. Its camera is very phenomenal specially the front camera comes with a wonderful face beauty feature. Its battery draining is very low. In my opinion its battery life is approx for 3 days. It comes with all the features a android phone must have.
It have a good battery life. It is a good phone for normal use. It is a copy of Samsung A20. It have a good finishing body. I have buy for 2 times.
Overall good at this price

Received damaged product. There was a dent across the sim card tray. Unfortunately I was not in town to receive the phone. By the time i came back and unpacked the phone it was beyond the return duration. It is unbelievable that a brand like Samsung can pack damaged item and sell it as brand new

Worst quality. Networks issues. That solve by changing motherboard and it's coast is more then mobile.... Damaged in just one month.
Dust is entering into camera lens. Dont buy guys. This phone model has defect of entering dust into camera lens.
"Initially I was happy to get such a good hardware this price. But as soon as I inserted sim problem initiates. Very poor network reception however at the same time other mobiles with same network showed 50 percent better reception. And Amazon is refusing to consider this issue.
As far as display is concerned it is one of the best display available in the market. Rear camera is superb but a bit disappointment is selfie camera. Battery life is good.

Overall if you can afford to compromise with network or in your area if network problem is not there then you can go for this mobile worth at this price"
Hitting problem. And memory cards slot not available
I certainly liked the build quality and camera at this price range.
Just ok
"Dont buy any samsung phones .iam facing a lot of issues with this phone .its fully hanged .before i buy this phone i think that m30 is 4gb ram,5000 mah battery so its very usefull for me because iam engg student but it is only used for mobile calling only ..  day by day its performance is worst. Its very pain full. The samsung phones is only for 60 aged persons ."

"Was eagerly waiting for the phone Samsung M20 4GB Ram, 64 GB Rom ocean blue variant with stylish looks. Thank you Amazon for such nice packaging. Except for the photos on Amazon it looks fabulous in real hands. It's a great phone with powerful features and the best thing is the price which is very reasonable.
The performance of the phone is really good. HD display with 16 cm screen. Fingerprint sensor works perfectly. Camera quality is just amazing adding with the wide lens. It's top notch full screen is good and it's bright enough for vivid colour display. The new processor is really quick and can easily manage multitasking with no lags. It has a huge battery backup with 5000 Mah battery. Dual VoLte support. It's useful for all groups of people especially travelers and business people. There's no reason I find it to compare it to any other phone. Samsung has just killed with this model. I will definitely recommend it to my friends and families.

But no widevine L1 certification which means you  cannot play amazon prime videos, hotstar and Netflix in HD, no slot for memory card and single led for all notifications. No Radio.

"We stopped in for a snack between lunch and dinner and luckily caught some great HH specials!    The restaurant was virtually empty on a Friday around 3pm, but I didn't mind much as we were in a hurry.  We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed the company of the chef.  

The service was a little bit rock to start off as I think 3 different people tried to take our order, but once it got rolling- we were good to go. 

I had some Sea Bass Nigiri ($3 for 2 pieces), Spicy Tuna Roll ($3-4), Edamame ($1.50), and a wonderful house salad topped with sliced pears and a delicious house dressing ($3).  The fish was all very fresh and clean tasting, but the salad was honestly my favorite!"

"Finally!  A Chinese restaurant on the west side that's really good!  Understand they've been here a year - on a Saturday night at 6:30pm they were packed - at 7:15pm, they were practically empty.  Now you know when to arrive.
Jo had Asparagas with Chicken and Shrimp, I had Kung Pao Beef...both excellent.  The spring rolls were very tasty.
I'd consider 5 stars except for the waiter - too much of a hurry, put down the spring rolls without sauce or mustard, never asked if we wanted anything.  I watched other waiters and they were much more thorough, so we just caught a poor one.
Go back again?  For sure!"

"First impression is good. What I liked the most is battery life. Runs more than a day and charge upto 50% in few minutes. In day to day this really comes handy.

Second the camera. Portrait mode and micro gave great photos. Initially had screen stability issue for slow motion video but that got fixed in patch update.

Display is really great. Audio is ok.

Happy for every penny spend."

Battery life.
All together it is a good package for an individual lookjng for a beast in cheap price with a brand. The phone built is solid performs all day to day tasks. Can't expect much from the processor but does well in this price segment. Camera and battery is a boon for owners.

I'd definitely see another game here in the future."

M30 is a smartphone with great battery life.big storage and decent ram.Triple camera is ok for still photography.Finger print reader is quick to respond.Battery of 5000mah serves your purpose throughout the day.Camera quality serves your purpose for daylight photography.128Gb internal storage what more you can ask for

"Phone is slow, fingerprint sensor also very slow. Camera quality is also poor."
"For a layman this phone is an absolute waste. My criteria for buying the phone were
- A good charge holding through a day
-Ease of taking photos
-Ease of usage of messaging and other apps
The phone heats ups at the slightest of use and the I keep getting alerts that the phone temperature has been stabilised
The charge of the phone will barely last you until noon with maybe about 10 calls
background apps keep running even if you dont need. The ease of getting around the settings is cumbersome.
If you open a video on whatsapp it dissappears into the back and only audio will keep playing. so embarassing when a call comes in
You cant silence the ring when the background video is playing
Absolutely unwieldy and dissapointing

"A heating issue-The major issue with the phone is heating up after some time(while playing games or internet download).Some time it is very hot you cannot touch it to ear for a moment. Camera is not good enough. Build quality is average. Not a good looking phone. Performance is not good as we see with Snapdragon 660 or 710.

Only battery and Display are very good. Otherwise phone is not good enough. It may be better if Samsung fix heatning issue, Camera performance as early as possible."

I would say this Phone is a One Man Army in its Segment and Price Range and plus Samsung Branded."
Amazing camerA.... Good battery and wide triple camera...all in all a good purchase....I liked the camera for its wide angle..
"Everything is at its best, except the 90hz screen won't give you 1day charge,
And i don't know why but my phone laggs 1 out of 10times in the dialing and contact screens,
And last but the most annoying thing is , headphone jack!
Believe me that jack connector has nothing more than just a connection extension with a little piece of wire but costs at least 300 rs and go upto 1500 also :D ..
I personally bought an local one in 50 rs and it didn't work coz of different config so i cut opened it and resoldered it 🙃. Now its awesome!
If headphone jack is so imp to you ? Then be ready to soen some extra cash of no worth 😒 .
And one last thing if you are a fan of those oxygen os customizations like in phones like yuphoria , they don't give it now☹️ it's color os now and it's just okay okay."
Smartphone which has good battery Life.
"OverAll a superb device.. fabulous camera, good speakers, fabulous warp charge, lovely Oxygen OS, UI, overall functionality excellent.

"What's the point of giving any feedback.Does it even matter? Well if it does than i would like to give the worst rating to this product plus amazon who pretends to put his customer satisfaction at first. Don't buy this product because it's not worth the value. Bad camera quality, only in a couple of minutes it can become a heating device. And the best part is even after having so many issues you are not able to change it because according to amazon policies you are not supposed to exchange the product even after having any difficulties with the same. So i am writing here, in case anyone read it please don't buy the product and get fooled just like me. Needless to say that, shopping on amazon and being the prime customer for a long time and this product gives me right now the greatest dissatisfaction."

"Rear camera is wide angled but low quality. Touch is bad, many times unresponsive.  Earpiece also creates some rattling noise while on call.

"Anytime I locate a Subway with BOOTHS, I put it on my list to go!  Yeah booths!  Ok, so today after my haircut at (4 Star) Great Clips here in the center, I hopped on in here.  

The ""SUButopian"":

*  Staff a little drifty.  There was no soup on the menu sign, so I asked Mr. Drifty I, the cashier, what kinds they had today, & the price.  He said, ""We don't have soup here"".  Ok, so I asked him what was in the two kettles three feet behind him.  ""Oh.  I guess we DO have soup, but I don't know what it is, or how much.""

Miss Nondrifty appears out of nowhere, & I ask her about it.  She agrees with me that it's not on the menu, & says they have Vegetable Soup & Broccoli Cheese Soup.  Fine, but I'm a meatie!  (Ok, the Broccoli Cheese is good, but I at least wanted Chicken Noodle which almost all Subways have every day.)

After receiving my sandwich (& skipping the soup), I put my cup under the ice dispenser & it was empty!  I gripe & in a few minutes Mr. Drifty III appears & pours a bag of ice into the soda dispenser.  We're at 2 Stars right now, including a boost for the clean, comfortable cafe atmosphere & nice booth to sit in.

Ok, the good:

Backtracking to just after the no soup/soup/no soup minute, & placing my order...   The place is a little busy, but it's not too long a wait for Mr. Drifty II to go to work on my sandwich.  I order a ""Subway Melt"" which comes with ham, turkey, bacon, your choice of cheese, & whatever veggies you want on it.  

I get it on their Honey Oat bread, & have him not toast it, but just nuke the four long slices of raw bacon.  The bread gets a thin coating of mustard on one side & mayonnaise on the other.  For cheese, it gets Pepper Jack (of several good choices), then a little lettuce, lots of tomato, some onion, Greek Pepper slices, & a squirt of Ranch Dressing.

OMG, it was terrific!!  ...and the October Special is ANY foot long sub  (except 2) for only $5!

SO, while this Subway doesn't come up to the 5 Star one down the street at 5130 W. Baseline, the great sandwich & value propelled this one up to 4 Stars (& I didn't need the soup anyway)!     :-))"

I had the grilled cheese with a cup of tomato soup. The tomato soup reminded me of pepperoni pizza, which was strange at first but actually pretty good. It was the perfect order for a chilly, rainy day. The 48th Street Fizz (orange vodka, pineapple, lemon, st. germaine, and beer) was sweet, but tasty (love cocktails with carbonation). They have an extensive list of local and regional beers. Overall, it's a nice little neighborhood spot."

"I usually try to stay away from the Arizona Mills mall. The mall itself has gotten crappier by the minute. Now, since I work close by, I was forced to go back to venture to Paradise Bakery. I honestly did not get my hopes up.

Since it was lunch time, it was not busy at all. Nothing is worse that being on your work lunch, starving, and standing in line. I opted for the Chicken Walnut Sandwich, with a cup of Tomato Soup. 

The sandwich was delicious and fresh. The bread was perfect as was the chicken walnut salad. You know...sometimes chicken salad can get really gross..slimey..salty...yucky. This one was perfect and the walnuts added a delicious crunch.

On to the soup. First off, I L-O-V-E tomato soup. It is my favorite. Would almost consider taking a bath in it. Hehehe...well, ok maybe not. BUT this soup rocked my socks off. Perfectly creamy, with a hint of smoky flavor, a small drizzle of sour cream and a few crunchy tortilla strips. YUM.

So, venture there to try the soup but scurry fast and take the food with you. Don't eat there. Take it somewhere, where you can have a moment alone with the soup.

I went on a Tuesday night at 6:30pm and was told they will not honor the coupon until 7pm.  However, I was told if I wanted to pay for a cut at the standard rate, they would take me ASAP.  Nobody was in the joint and they refused to take my Livingsocial coupon until after 7pm."
Good battery life and display

Awesome
Some how the screen got cracked even after using mobile cover and high quality tempered glass. Mobile did not fall nor has any physical damage. Shocked that even Samsung charged whopping 6500 for replacement. Not happy with the screen quality
Best budget Smartphone ... And the camera and battery are awesome ...
"the finger scanner is not so fast,camera is good especially the wide angle feature,the best part is battery,1 to1.5 says on full charge."
Camera quality
i like it and all butttt your not going to have it at the august 7th concert which hurts my feelers
Got @4999 with 2.5 year old Moto g5 plus exchange
Bad product. I've more issues
Overall very good phone. Bought it for my father. He charges it once in 4 days. Only drawback was that many third-party junk apps come pre-installed and not possible to delete.
Camera quality is not so good competitive in 12 k range. Spend 1.5 k more for good option.
Don't buy waste of money
"Camera quality is really good, but if I receive a call then Internet stops working and I've to disconnect and connect to wifi again."
Super quality
Extraordinary phone with awesome features...blindly go for it
This is how I received product. Product also not working after 4 days. Then replacement also not processed well. Finally returned and bought another brand product.
Best phone in this price range. Amazing performance and superb camera. Excellent overall package.
Phone hangs
"Good Things
•The shape & design is vibrant in color is up to the mark
•The sorround sound speakers are extremely high in sound.
•The camera pixels are proper pixeled.
Bad Things
•The phone gets hanged quite often.
•It restricts proper function when using it in  use.
•Sometimes fingerprint accepts and there and then rejects."
Battery not good
After use of 1 week touch started working on its own and it is automatically doing some actions worst product dear amazon team kindly open return window for me I wanna return this product
Good quality mobile
"Value for money
Likes (pros):
AMOLED display in this price is really a good deal
Face recognition is quick
Rear camera gives great day light pictures
Inspite of a 3GB ram it's application function smoothly.
Flagship from Samsung feels like quality at a base price.

Cons:
An extra 500 mAh battery addition would leave no room for any additional requirements."
Fine
"Nyc phone
Sound is good and camera is good but not satisfied"
Camera quality and display quality is very poor and phone is heavy weight and phone size also big

"Trusted as a consistent Friday HH or evening meal/get together spot for a long time. We have been a slave to the Wingless Buffalo Dip the whole time. We have been fortune enough have a great server (Mallory) most of our visits as well. She has never steered us wrong in food choices. I have had the pizzas, the sandwiches and even some special entrees. It has all been good. The Reuben sandwich is a favorite and so is the Sonoran burger. The sweet potatoes fries are always really good side. 

Now some friends have had some bad experiences with service. They have a hard time returning. It happens, esp. when it is first Friday or when the host staff is out of their minds, there is just an inconsistency there. But don't let that ruin the tone of the meal.

Awesome Patio. Parking can be a pain, but sometimes you can park close around the corner. Great mix of people, so good people watching too. Seating is tight at times, because sometimes you are seated right next to another table where you can here each others convos. Can be fun at times. Def. take all of our out of town guests here. Great HH spot."

Yes,it is perfect in this price range.
Camera quality is good but not best.
Portrait mode is absent in both views i.e. front & rear view.
Unlocking through fingerprint reader and face unlock both are fast and best.
Battery life is good as it is 5000mah it is good.
Fast charging is not actually so fast but yes it is almost good..
Overall,review on this phone is if you are thinking about this phone just buy it because at this price it is best and perfect phone..."

Performance & display excellent
Very nice product M10s mobile phone. Value for money. Thanks Samsung for such a great product and services.
"Decent budget phone. Lots of noise around the screen resolution but after using it for this long, don't feel the diff in daily usage, thanks to the AMOLED screen. Performance, Camera, battery life and  Stock Android experience outweigh the screen resolution issue.
Hope to get Android 10 soon."

The overall look gives a premium feel,
Deserves 5 star for this cute little monster,."

"I will get straight to it then.
This phone is too fragile, as I have learned the painfully expensive way!
The fell off just 2 feet above the ground and the screen broke along with damage to charging point, cost me over 7000/- INR to get it working again.

Pros:
->Good Battery
->Samsung OneUI Andriod 9 Pie (Updated)
->lots of RAM, won't slow anything
->Gaming Performance: You would play all games @ Low to Medium settings
->Doesn't Heat up even if used heavily for long duration

Cons:
->Super Fragile Display
->Very Expensive to Replace the Display if Damaged
->Lots of Samsung Partner ads, and unnecessary notifications from samsung partners"
Like and very good

Display is awesome due to super amoled.
Battery will last 1.5 days easily with moderate usage.
Camera is also value for money

And remember its came with Android 10 pre-installed with OneUI 2.0"
Problem with network signal(tried with multiple networks). Sensors are not that efficient. Not worth for the money. I would rather suggest Moto or MI

Becomes slow after a few months just like all other cheap phones of Samsung. Never thought that I'd say this but Redmi is much better when it comes to affordable mobile phones.

"The brand has delivered once again. I have been using the OnePlus 7 before this. But the 7T is not just an incremental upgrade. It has much more to it. Let's start with a few key differences between the OnePlus 7 and 7T
1) The vibration motor has now haptic feedback. Much better than linear motor on op 7 and almost similar to OP7 Pro. I love it.
2) The phone is slimmer and has a better feel in hand though bigger but has a more sharp corners which adds decency in contrast to rounded corners on OP7. Also notch size is reduced.
3) the cameras. Well everyone knows about the cameras. I would like to say that the macro lens that uses the ultrawide lens, is not just a gimmick. It can take photos of fabrics that even the eyes cannot see.
4) the smoothness of 90hz screen is just really good to experience.
5) The antutu benchmark score. 400000 in comparison to 370000 of oneplus.
6) the dual speakers. The ear piece speaker has now higher volume than bottom speaker. On the 7 it was opposite. Also 7t's sound is slightly richer than 7.
7) Well the warp charge 30T really adds up. It charges the phone from 0 to 67 in 30 mins. And 0 to 100 in 61 mins. Saves a lot of time. Whereas the 7 takes 86 mins.
8) it comes pre installed with Android 10. So 2 Android updates are guaranteed. Whereas 7 came with Pie. Most likely to get an update less.

Well now the cons:
1)I got a little defective piece. The screen adhesive was slightly visible on left hand side. So opted for a replacement.
2)  The wifi sometimes disconnects and thrn reconnects on its own. Maybe a software issue. OnePlus might fix it soon.

Well got it for 36k from Amazon. A must buy phone. Cannot keep myself from recommending. Kudos to OnePlus."

Suggestion - Don't update MiUi11.02 yet, it's buggy in note8.. The screen and fingerprint don't respond for 3-4sec after leaving the phone idle for 15+min.. then they resume back to normal speed, but will again lag if left idle.. Hope Xiaomi will correct this issue in future versions of MiUi.."

Whatsapp features aren't working properly even after updating OS.
Selfie camera quality is good but rear camera gives shaky photos like ut is too sensitive of even blood circulation of our hands hurts the quality of the picture which we take from this camera. This needs to be resolved samsung mobile.  I think Blood beats shouldn't effect the shaky thing of the camera quality.
Battery life is amazing.
The hanging problem of samsung handsets remains the same in this handset too."

Only a Mexican food snob would undrmine such a great Traditional restaurant (and believe me we have plenty of those here in Arizona). This is old school Mexican food folks and it's about as good as it gets. The atmosphere is classic and I personally enjoyed it but it is not upscale  but then again Mexican food normally isn't. It's simple and that's what Arriba's is. If Arriba's were located in any Eastern state it would easily be the best in the entire state. The beans were great the salsa was delicious and the service was fast.
"We found Ippei happhazardly through United Airline's dining points program and were instantly hooked.  We now frequent the place at least once or twice a week.

A great atmosphere with a very warm and welcoming host, Michael.  It has all of the ambiance of a very chic place, without the attitude and pompous feel.  The wait staff are all very attentive and pleasant.  The drinks are creative.  And if you're lucky, the owner may join you in a sake bomb, though he insists this is not authentic Japanese tradition.

I'm not a huge sushi person and was mainly brought along by my friends, so I can't comment on all the finer touches on the sushi and whatnot.  I can say, however, that if you ask really nicely you may be able to try a roll that the chefs are working on that is not yet on the menu, including a rib-eye roll that is absolutely delicious and friendly to those of us that shy away from sushi because of the whole raw fish deal.

Prices are very reasonable.  This is an up-and-coming spot that is still fairly quiet, but not for long.  Come now before you have to worry about getting a reservation a week ahead of time.  As it is now, you can just walk in.

Great place to bring a date - low lighting, great service, great food, lots of fun."

"Stopped by for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. Did not realize that the place had just opened (or at it appeared that way). Quite crowded with patrons, a bubble machine, and a DJ. 

It was bit loud with all the commotion, but still within reason. The menu is compact, but offered all the usual suspects. I went for the Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of cole slaw. I dumped the cole slaw on top of the pork and went to town on the sandwich. Meat was moist and smoky. The sauce had a hint of of kick. Very tasty.

The service was a bit slow, but the place was pretty much full up so I expected it to take a bit of time.

Good joint. Would return."
"Watched #GOPDebates; loved #BenCarson closing statement. ""#Trump is affectionate mad man while Carson is affectionate person who cares.""🇺🇸"
So far so good
No doubt an excellent product with great features and functionalities. Camera is exceptionally good. Only thing I didn't liked is the removal of headphone jack.
Heating problem&complete charging takes more than 6 hours eventhough it has provided fast charging. Don't purchase this mobile.I am Samsung lover in future I never purchase Samsung mobiles.

"Although oppo f15 has all the features which the same brand oppo reno z has with a prices 4k less than that.It is a light weight phone.

Coming to the point phone which i received  has a software issue.
1.It gets rebooted during calls
2.Reboots while taking photos
3.Amazon and other apps gets hanged and restarts automatically.All efforts gets wasted while surfing.
4.After rebooting a recovery mode option comes which asks to choose the option to wipe out the data,power off and it gets rebooted at least 3,4 times.
5.I have requested for a exchange and an inspection has been scheduled.Hoping to get a good set this time without software bug."
Been working lots of overtime this week. Only just realized I booked a half day tomorrow so this week will just break even
Done some book signings in Manchester. Nice people up there. Enjoy the week.
Absolutely disappointed with the finger print scanner in this phone its not working as expected and well below par when compared with other compittors. There is some audio problem with the phone and I will be contacting the service team shortly. Will extend my review once I contact the service team
"Five Guys offers a decent burger, but it's definitely overcooked--they brag about serving them well done and there's no argument here: that's what they are. But I much prefer the flavor of Smashburger's meat. Five Guys seemed rather devoid of meaningful seasoning, or if it was there, it was killed in the well-doneing. 

I also didn't really like that it comes out as two carelessly charred mini-patties, instead of one, nicely cooked and seasoned burger.

As far as Mill-area burgers are concerned, I'm at the following:
1.Smashburger  2. Chuckbox 3.  In N Out 4. Five Guys 5. Fatburger

And Chuckbox and Smashburger are awfully close. I've been a HUGE fan of Chuckbox for forever, so many I like the newness of Smashburger, but damn is it tasty. I also prefer the Smashfries to Chuckbox's fries, but I think I prefer 5 Guys' fries to both of them.

Finally, the price is obnoxious. You're not getting that much in the way of a burger for $11 (drink + fries + cheeseburger). You get a MOUNTAIN of fries, but I don't NEED that many fries. You also get to top it with just about anything, but I don't want to subsidize other people's toppings. Let me pay $2 less to get mine with lettuce, ketchup, and mayo.

Overall a meh burger. Not great, but better than Fatburger, if I don't want to walk to College for great burgerness.

Oh, as for atmosphere, it was like a club in there. I really don't need to be bombarded with music at lunch when I'm going to talk to someone. I hate shouting and the few times when the song would switch and the grill would quiet was like the eye of the storm. Turn that shit down."

"I used to be a huge fan of this place, but it was just ok this time around..

A bunch of us went and I ordered their steak for two.. 22oz. Thought it might be good.  It was dry and had no flavor.  She had asked at the beginning ""Do you guys want A-1?""  I said ""No thanks.""  A good steak shouldn't need any sauce.  I should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg..

We also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  I love the one they do at Cheesecake  Factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.  

Everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  He got the chicken fried steak.  Cant really mess that up I guess.  it was pretty good. 

Id go back, but Im not the fan i used to be of this place."
"Ticks most boxes . Good stereo sound through three speakers .Fast fingerprint reader.

"Size of galaxy M 20 according to length as well as breadth is so fine that it will amaze the public. The moment I bought this phone I fell in love with the design.

"Food is ok. Pad Thai is sub-par. The happy hour is very cool baby suburban around this joint. 
It's attached to Chandler Fashion Center, so it's busy pretty much all of the time. happy hour specials are just ok, specialty drinks are pretty expensive with little taste and even less alcohol.
plus, i loathe happy hours that you can only enjoy in the ""bar"" area. the patio is the spot for HH, and it's LOUD. not just with vapid chatter, but with the constant scraping of meatl chairs on the concrete. it sounds like i'm being picky, but it's one of those sounds that makes your skin crawl and just kills your mood instantly - over and over and over.

"This phone is good with respect to performance and camera.  But the battery is not lasting for the whole day even with nominal usage.  However, the main problem is with the proximity sensor.  While attending the calls, the loud speaker  do not disturb , torch , battery saver options are automatically get enabled/disabled due to this issue.  I first tried to return the first phone due to this issue and was able to get only a replacement after speaking to Amazon call center.  Even the same problem arise with the replaced phone as well and then I come to know that the proximity sensor is a known issue with MI A2 and still not been fixed.  People who are considering MI A2 should be aware of this issue before buying."

Prone to lag. Screen rotation hangs at times. Finger print reader is also slow. Phone doesn't wake up when power button is pressed once. Need to press it twice. Battery life is also not as good as claimed and I am not even using power hungry apps. Purchased the phone relying on good past experience with Samsung phones but this phone is a disappointment!!!

"When there is a video call camera pops up while it is ringing, it should have been camera popping up when I accept the call. This put the selfie camera on risk if the phone is in your pocket n it starts ringing

I have to admit that I'm particularly tough on restaurants filled with...I don't know what to call them...scenesters, I guess.  Service was ok.  Its not BAD, mind you, its just that I don't get it.

"While the idea is not new - an updated outdoor shopping center that mimics a European outdoor shopping and residential district, Kierland Commons is similar to West Village in Dallas, TX or Santana Row in Santa Clara, CA, however, in the Scottsdale version, it is completely stripped of any personality and design, perhaps to better blend in with the desert environment.

The usual suburban chain stores can be found at this shopping center, ranging from Smith and Hawken, Banana Republic, Barnes & Noble and the like, though there are a select few independent retailers which make a trip to this center a little more interesting.  Parking can be difficult, however, there are lots that line the backside of the center as well as valet parking across from the center park.  People watching is quite entertaining, from the kiddies that frolick in the fountains, to Barbie's desert siblings.

The independent dining options are a little more interesting, such as The Green House and Zinc Bistro, though again, the usual unimaginative chains are represented here, including PF Chang's and The Cheesecake Factory.  

While I don't find most of the retail offerings at Kierland Commons to be particularly compelling to make multiple repeat visits, I will return for the more independent dining options."
"I bought this phone a month back with lot of expectations and enthusiasm since I already owned OnePlus 3 and was very happy with the phone. But all that enthusiasm and expectations died down within 3 weeks, since my screen got damaged in an unusual way. The phone offers 90Hz Refresh rate with a very good display but at the cost of a risky design. I see this as a design / manufacturing issue which one plus is not ready to accept.

The worst part is the Customer Support team and Servify (One Plus Care team) teams who are very unprofessional and change their stance every minute. I was initially told that the screen will be replaced since it was just 3 weeks after purchase. Later I was told to purchase a 1 year Accidental protection plan which I did at additional cost. After purchasing this plan they said, I will not be covered for various reasons and the plan will be no more valid. I had to wait for one week with multiple calls and then shell out 12,000/- Rs from my pocket to get the screen replaced. The Ad says Screen Protection (Pre-filled)...god only knows what this means. I am duped really with the worst customer service team of One plus.

Yes while the phone is very attractive with lot of great features...do not forget the quote ""All that glitters is not Gold"". Keep this in mind before you shell out 35+ k to buy this phone.

My only hope now is Amazon since I have reported the issue to them and hope they will do something to reduce the pain I went through."
Camera and fingerprint sensor is working ok but battery is given 5000 mah and its working like 2500 mah battery now you can imagine how the battery is. And it has mic problem also. When i answer any phone call he ask me restart if you want to use the mic.

"I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale. Well something has changed... I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers, no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help. They were all too busy talking with one another. And to add insult to to injury... one clerk had to walk around me (didn't ask if I needed help) and went to play with one of the customers dogs.... I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there, but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing.   I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience, very positive.  I'll stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers."

"I'm working downtown now (new themed list to come soon!) so I'm exploring the area from a different angle. I'm no stranger to downtown/midtown's happy hour and dinner spots, but I've never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day. 

I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadn't had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied. 

The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick. 

The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia."

"After long time Samsung has produced mid range mobiles having all high end features. HD display, finger print and Face lock, latest android, 5K battery and many more features.
Don’t think much and go ahead with this. Ocean blue looks stunning."
"I have been reading the reviews of people regularly... But still iam Wondering bcoz y people r giving 5 or 4 star rating to this product.. Entairly opposite of what they shown in configuration about camera of this mobile it
Camera looks like primium quality VGA MOBILES,and performance is also not that much what they expected as shown in configuration... I dont suggest this to any ONE... IAM IN ONE OF TOP users who buy this in  first onehour of launching the mobile in amazon..."
I do the same thing to anybody covering dave... haha... we don`t like people messing with perfect music.
"Phone is very slow I hardly had few apps loaded and using 1 app at a time still found it very slow.
Camera quality is very low.
If you for brand then it's good or else buy other phone they will give you much better performance"
Owsome
" Good luck  I wanna see them again too. I waited outside by their buses to see them before, no autographs tho!"
"Samsung is selling this online on low price. Same model with another name and higher rate is available in show rooms. So they are given worst quality product online purchase as within 20 days, screen stopped working and was not able to return this due to 14 days return policy. This was one of the worst online experience where you paid for good product and getting product which does not survive even for 20 days. Samsung has compromised with quality for low online rate. Tried calling customer care. They had also refused to return. Took that to one service centre they had factory reset the phone and returned. It was not working at all."

Worth buying
But I thought that in the box , they will give us Bluetooth earphones but later I found that those were meant for only promoters
Anyways the product is awesome and beats any other phone"
Amazing product value for money
Great deal

This phone running is not good Many times automatically process stop and network problem only in this phone which I buy from Amazon its my mistake wrong think purchase at this platform I suggest you all guys please not buy this phone at this platform
Performance and battery not accurate as expected before .
"Looks good.... processor is capable...miui is nice....speaker sound is accurate.... battery life is long enough...fast charging is fast

Cameras are not as expected...screen colours are  over saturated and not bright enough... phone feels bigger and bulky....cover provided in box can't protect your cameras....lacks gcam support till now.... heating quickly"
Battery life is awesome camera is too good
"Phonereally has lots of issues with no way to work around them aside from fundamental layoffs like build quality. Even after updating to latest version of software 10.3.8 I am facing serious problems as mentioned below:

1. There is a known multi touch issue with this device when you put 2 fingers and then introduce a third finger near the first two even after  moving away 3 touch points the third one remains intact means it is ghost touch.

2. Phone display is of cheap quality considering for how much this phone was sold originally when it was manufactured (Dec 2018) , when typing it gives serious lag because touch is faulty you will notice it if you try to type faster and this issue is even recognised by Alvin Tse on twitter but since it is hardware issue it can't be solvef through OS updates.

3. Battey Drainage. The phone battery drains very quickly for being a 4000 mAh, you can found this issue too mentioned and recognised many times in Miui forum. Still after all the updates no fix is there. It is annoying.

4. Bad speaker quality, speakers are not adequately loud to my liking.

Only 2 stars, one for camera and one for big screen."

"Ok first thing I want to tell you guys my overall expierience with the phone is good( Not Wow obivously 😜). Following are the concise technical pointers ideal for all users ranging from so called tech experts to Layman:

Pros:
1) Battery Life: Superb( Can compete with high endphones)
2) Finger reader: Good( It is on the back side of the phone. Bit inconvient to use and you end up using lame 1234 pinlock😂🤣)
3) Camera: China ka Maal😂( I dont know which lens or megapixels they are using and i don't even care. It is way behind the league, iphone users you can definately trust me on that😜)
4) Touchscreen: Disaster😈( Screen feels like absolute disaster, Touch sensitivity is imbalanced and feels like 2011ish)
5) Looks: Good( Samsung worked hard on looks and it is definately a thumbs up for the looks)
6) Speed: Average( Well once again I dont care about processor series. It simply doesn't deliver as required by modern day standards)
7) UI Interface: Very Good( Its simple and good looking. No worries at all)
8) Sound: Superb( Powered by Dolby DTS it is simply superb. Muh band ho gaya, when I connected it to my sony speakers😶)
9) Call Quality: Good( Bit fragile voice, but kaam chal sakta hai 😜)"
Nice phone

I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because it's easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!

"Oppo F11 with 48-megapixel sony imx 586 sensor-
if photo / video is the primary reason in selecting a mobile.
The quad-bayer array pixel binning
 it performs is effective- making a 12mp take a 48mp like image.
Comes with a fast lens- F1.8 (rear).
If your aperture is going to be fixed, it better be fast.
The still camera manual controls extend the limits of a cameraphone-
 ISO, Shutter speed, Focus, Exposure compensation, Colour temperature.
It also employs various softwares for various shooting conditions.
Charges fast, drains slow. It’s always ready for work!"
I like all things at this price with brand name.
Nyc mobile ... delivery was so good.
The company website is www.ahlstrom.com .
It's only 10 months and my phone has been seen software damage already

Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea. Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.
"At this price point I guess one of the best pure Android experience. It's so fluid n you will never feel a lag. One bonus point, gcam are working like charm on this phone without any root or more detailed settings. Great job Xiaomi!"
It's only been a few days after the first month of purchase and now it has a big problem. The call is not sent at first. Then you have to restart the phone to call. This was least expected of Samsung.
"Pros: very gud camera quality,fast processor,
Cons: supported 18w charging but with box we get 10w charger"
"Battery is much  long lasting and no heating issues, camera is much slow , but overall nice product  at this price"
worst mobile ... dont buy it... from day one there is problem in mobile...3-4 times technician arranged by amazon..but issue not resolved... very worst exp with this samsung mobile.
4.5
I just loved this phon😍😍😍😍. The white color looks primium. The camera quality is damn high compared to 13000. And battery also lasts long. Don't be confused if u want to purchase this phon. Trust me it's an honest review. And fingerprint is quick as compared to A50. ... Thnx Amazon😘😚

When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.  I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!!

If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go!

Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO."

"My friends and I were in Arizona for Dodgers' spring training a few weeks ago and were at the mercy of Yelp for finding things to keep us busy at night. After talking to a few of the bartenders at Bobby C's Lounge (LOVE THIS PLACE), which we found on Yelp, they told us about Char's. On a Sunday night, Char's had live music and a packed dance floor. With an awesome mix of Old School Funk, Reggae, Classic Rock, and even a little Santana action, the live band was ON POINT! We were singing and dancing to every song! The crowd was fairly diverse and everyone was friendly. I could definitely see this as a relaxing place to go after a long day, where you don't necessarily have to wear ""club attire"" to fit in. The vibe was very chill and the drinks were great. I'll definitely be coming to Char's the next time I'm in town. 

GO DODGERS! :)"

Stupid shopping bags left a red mark on my arm

Samsung galaxy M20 is best mid range  phone. picture quality & battery back-up is mind blowing. it is really amazing ! that you get a branded phone in this range.
RT @rickbot5000: Our news media is broken #GOPDebate
It has problem with network. Where other model shows full tower it shows only 1 or 2 tower. There for not worked well in underground areas like basement.
"- Good phone with a decent camera and features like Fingerprint scan is very nice.
- Battery back-up is reasonably good and you don't need a recharge for 48 hrs for sure unless you use the phone extensively to play Games or on 4G for good
- The only discomfort I observed it that the SWITCH ON Button and the VOLUME UP-DOWN button are both provided on the same side, on the right side of the phone which makes certain operation cumbersome. This should have been avoided"
Entertainment  at its finest.  Can't  help but wonder how #educated  #Americans are reacting  to #GOPDebate or the lack thereof.
Camera disappointed
Worst battery

So, I requests you to please replace the product."
I am now fan of onplus.great performance.just one day review...... Amazing.
Mobile quality is bad.
Good phone at this price range. Would definitely recommend in these times where a new phone is launched every month. Instead of spending 40k on oneplus spend 15k on this phone and keep changing the phone every year.
Amazing phone. Met all expectations. Bought it for a friend who is non gamer so for him it is all he ever needed. Happy
"Phone is not good at all, very slow and hang also. Not recommended."
Camera quality is best. Value for money.  Charging speed is insanely fast.
Good product
Very good product
"Fingerprint sometimes can't working properly,
Camera quality in low light not good, battery life is so good"
Price loose 😡😡 53000 k liyaa ab 42000 same
Selfie camera is not good
"Without a doubt the best phone in this price range. Beating its many similar competitors , undoubtedly this is my best ever phone ever. Effortless operation, no hanging complaints, no other issue keeps. E happy. Battery lasts at least a day in spite of using internet/YouTube etc. Fingerprint reader placed at correct position helps you to use the phone effectively"
Best mobile for mobile under 15k
"I did not like this mobile because it brings a lot of ads, due to which I am having problems."
The worst phone by Samsung the charger and the cable both not working after 1 month of use of the phone some time the battery work for 2 days and some time it work for 1 day only the speed of internet occur fast in sim 1  slot and slow in sim 2 slot .I think i have get defective handset

All high end android games are running as smooth as butter. Fast launching of apps will make you buy another mi phone for your loved ones. Go for it, it's not 1 year old model , rather at least 2 years younger then other phones in this price range."

I buy this product just one month before but i am disappointed with the performance of the battery because it get fully discharge within five hour's with normal use.mobile set also get heated.i want to replace this mobile any how kindly help
It is definitely a value for money phone. Camera quality is pretty decent for the price range. Ive bought it mainly for the RAM and internal memory. It completely delivers well

"When someone edit your designs is called plagiarism right??, but what can you do??, I`m tired, exhausted and dissapointed"
I loved the overall performance of the phone. The macro mode is exceptionally good. The battery performance is real good. Stands for almost 1 and a half days even with intense use. Real worth for the money.
"Over all it's a good budget phone on this price,  but when I charge the phone. The battery got hit. That is the reason I gave ⭐⭐⭐⭐"

@RealBenCarson said a mouthful. #RunBenRun #Carson2016 #GOPDebate http://t.co/rpQo4SQBTo
I Love Amazon for the very nice offer.
Phone is too heavy to hold and operate. My fingers are painting after use of 10 minutes. If you have this phone no need of dumbell for exercise. I purchased without checking weight and not able to return now. Please do not buy if you want a light weighted phone. Didn't expected this from Samsung.
Good phone

I am currently un happy to u r service and this product also.i faced lot of problems with this phone.so if any chance to replace it.hi heating.
"Phone is good, 90hz display is good, camera is also quite good.
Cons
1. Battery life is short and 90hz takes a lot of battery.
2. Slow motion inside room flickers a lot.
3. No headphone jack
Tip
If on long drive and using map on this phone , use it in night mode else the battery will die even if you are charging it."
just pre-ordered your new album `Off The Deep End`. Been listening to `Permanent Heart` on repeat since.
Battery life is not as one plus standard
16% of United States homes with TV sets watched the #GOPDebate — more than any in recent history: http://t.co/OeKKHQomt1
"I grew up at Word of Grace (now City of Grace). Way before the new buildings and it just the small little church. I love Pastor Gary. I would give him 5 stars. We moved but I had always considered this my home church. When we moved back to AZ I started again and was really disappointed with the young adults ministry and praise and worship. I left when I wasn't getting anything out of it and not much longer did they join with City Church. I think they are struggling but I have hope for them. Pastor Terry is the new head pastor and he has the Joel Osteen vibe, which isn't for me, but he is very nice. 

They are non- denominational and love their congregation enough to handle sins or situations other churches don't want to touch in fear of being labeled as 'haters' or what not. I hope that anyone who attends will understand their views do not come from hate. It makes me sad that the other reviewer had such a negative experience and I don't doubt that she wasn't treated with kindess as every church seems to have those rude people. I am not sure what she means by 'closed-minded' but I know there are people like that at every church. I hope others do not have that experience and I hope the church can work on that as a whole. people need to feel welcome and accepted as they are. 

They are also awesome with the community- homeless outreaches, drug addiction help, and so many things I cannot begin to list. If you ever want to help your community City of Grace would be a great place to get ideas of where/how you can help. 

 If pastor Terry isn't for you I would recommend Cornerstone Chandler(my home church) or Central Christian. They are not closed-minded but they also won't ignore sins that are major issues. IE divorce, porn, sex, sexuality, infedility, etc.  Good luck on finding your home church!!"
Ok

"The property is beautiful and clean.  Restaurant's were great.  The problem is the front desk snobs.  No personality.  They messed up my reservations, made me and my family find our own hotel for the night that they messed up?  They didn't even try to get us another room, despite me paying any price.  After a long day of travel with an infant, toddler and wife, the last thing I want to do is look for another hotel at 11 PM, only to come back the next day.

The attitude of the front desk is sad and horrible."
"Well I am using OnePlus since OnePlus 5 launch.
Not an adequate phone. Battery life is not good like other OnePlus phones. Even OnePlus 5t is giving better battery life. Camera is good. Phone is lagging sometime. Frequent lag while playing pubg mobile game. Sensors are not working properly. Like tap to show fingerprint in ambient display not working, notifications are not showing in ambient display even it is turned on."

"I got this mobile a month back. Frequently not able to call even though mobile is showing full signal strength. When others trying to call my number, it shows busy/not-reachable most of the time. Rarely able to call others.  Disappointed with this Samsung M30. Whenever i try to call, it shows ""Not registered on Network"" message. I changed SIM card. But still seeing same issue. SIM works fine with other handset.

it worked for 1st 15 days only. After that i started seeing the problem. Now only i confirmed that its not a SIM issue and only problem with Samsung M30 Mobile. Same inconsistency with mobile data network as well.

Bad experience. I lost many important calls due to this issue. Started using New handset now :("
_Sweethearts Im following you but you aren`t on my DM list  Can you try to DM me?
I'm quite disappointed with face recognition feature.. most of the time it doesn't recognize my face even when i try to unlock in light.. other than that i didnt had any issues with the phone.
"Finger print scanner is desent fast
Camara is asome"
Nice
"Camera quality not like brand havi issue of blur.
Still low light photography is worst."
Battery life is very good
Nice phone in this rate.. MI always give us best rate in the market price and Amazon also gr8 offers to buy the phone in cheap easier.
"If you are a true display lover...then this phone is not for you, in short it has 720p (max 720p in YouTube) display which is big cons if you have seen this phone live/in hand then you can understand what i mean. it comes with amoled panel which is okay okay but Not great. Also it has low nits (brightness) than other phones in same price or mi company. Fingerprint sensor is slow but it can be fixed via system updates also camera is great but not like mi a2 (beaty mode is bad than mi a2) battery life is good like mi 3s, rn5pro and all other 4000mah phones, design is good and handy also processor is fast than expected

Overall good deal in 13000. Also get some extra discount in sales"
"Poor Fingerprint reader
Poor performance
Battery life is good"
"A only word i could express about this redmi note 8 pro is super worth for the money paid. As i could not explain much abt technical but i would suggest just go for it. Itsa awesome look wise, battery wise, etc etc."
"It's a great phone. I really loved it. The day I came to know about the phone I was really excited to see
it and it really stood up to my expectations. Face unlock, notch display, camera are few of the amazing
features of this phone. Battery life is really great. I charged the phone to 100% and even after 20hrs it
came down to only 52% and that's really great. For youngsters battery life of the phone is most
important and it definitely fullfills that criteria. Samsung M20 is one the best phones I've come across in
past 5yrs. Thankyou Samsung and Amazon for this amazing phone."

Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that), wontons in soup that fall apart, greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls, it's just not worth it.  Prefer to give locals the business, but this is truly awful, even after many hopeful tries.  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job."

Very nice phone
"Little bit lacks in battery. Beautiful Specs and Display. Love the phone.
I just picked up an phone which is Samsung m30 and I'm so happy to make the right decision.
Talking about this phone, this comes with normal battery life and I can stream all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. I already have 200 plus photos in my phone
The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)"
Great
One word unbeatable
Value for single rupee
Oneplus gives you premium quality phones in Android. Camera is best. Battery life is okay lasts for whole day but on very heavy work need to charge. Charging is just awesome 45min whole phn is charged. Bulit quality is pretty good. If you are thinking for android go for oneplus rather than expensive note phones. Oneplus always gives you update on time to time so no worry that your phone become old. I used oneplus 6 till it is getting updates. Unfortunately i lost it. I trust oneplus so again going for it. Oneplus is best for android no one can beat it. Really happy with my new oneplus 7t😀😀

"Wowza!  This place is a total trip!  No, I don't smoke, but if I did this place is probably the place I would go to.  

First off, the food was okay.  I ordered some chicken wings, which wasn't really that great.  My favorite was the Thai Curry -- it definitely had some pop to it.  It's one of those that creep up on you.  Milk please!  My friend ordered some Sake that I thought was real good and smooth -- don't ask me what it was, the lighting was low and I didn't care much by the time I arrived.

Service was pretty good I guess, and then again the place was drop dead for a Friday night.  What's up with that!?  I'm sure the place gets hopping on 1st Friday, but that's only one day out of the month -- I sure it picks up quick!

Ambience, was cool, just reminded me of the 70's in a way even though I didn't grow up during the 70's haha, but I thought the design and decor were pretty cool.  Eccentric I think was the word I used.  Bathroom was blue and that's all I'll say.......check it out! - Enjoy!"
At this price range it's suoerb phone so go without options at this range....
This device is much better than previous devices I have used. I frequently travel so I have tested the battery life it's long enough to use during long jurnies. Camera quality is superb.
Liked the product worth buying it .macro photography at its best .night mode not upto the mark.

"This is a fun POOL party club in Scottsdale next to everyone's favorite, American Junkie. I have never eaten here, other than a dessert that I don't remember. ;) It can also be a fun place for after dinner drinks or dance. The ambiance of relaxing and drinking next to a pool always brings about a good time. The music is LOUD and the bartenders are nice. Their bathrooms are clean and pretty. 

Spanish Fly rages during the daytime summer weekends, and is a great place to hang out when you still want to enjoy the outdoors and it's blazing hot outside. I will be going back - glad to have you in Scottsdale, Spanish Fly."

"Best Android phone ever. Couldn't ask for more, Love it. But not satisfied with the battery back up. Lasts upto 5 hours when used continuously. Camera is amazing as all the features works exactly as mentioned. Charges at high speed. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good too."
" heyy dude, yuup thats it really hows your monday?  x"
"First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate. Yeah the place is filthy, but how they operate their business is redicolus. Service sucks, 49 minute wait for the food sucks, waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks, being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food, that they are out of your side dishes, sucks, spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense, sucks. At first our group thought it was a joke, then the reverse racism theory was brought up, then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service. Black, white, purple,orange. They just sucked."
"Phone not seems like a 6GB ram & worst Performance while using Multiple tasks ..
Processer should be strong ,while playing Pubg so much of lagging while using some heavy apps always lags !!
3x charging speed ? It's Fake !! It's probably takes 2& half an hours to battery Full..
Camera Quality  Good ! Not better .. No slow motion  😟

Display clarity alone no one could competate"
Nice mobile
Parpamence is so slow

The audio looks very low while listening
Good product. Value for money.
"I never used Redmi phone before but this phone has changed my perception of thinking. Currently in the market there are so many similar smartphones are there but choosing good product in the same price is always a challenge and I think this phone has everything including specifications of Battery life, Camera, RAM, Processor, Alexa and most important is heat issue which we heard about Redmi most of the time but there in no heat issue at all."
Every thing good expect the  battery life.

"Nice product within 16K, although when compared with other options available in market this might not be immediate choice but believe me you will not regret being an Owner of Samsung M31.

Amazing quality of camera have already made me cameramen within my circle and a selfie geek, Battery is as promised, works whole day with just 50% with extensive use of GPS and WIFI and well as internet. What more can be asked for 16k when you are getting 128 GB and 6 GB memory with perfectly great fingerprint sensors and face lock.

Only cons I found: Weight should have been a bit less and size is not very much comfortable with skinny pants.

Overall, best handset in recent times and would always be looking for new models of Samsung within this price range. Good luck Samsung."
Total waste of money ....

A year ago I bought this mobile based on its popularity and it's good features. But today I'm just fed up of this mobile because last 2 months I'm facing problem that this mobile gets restart anytime and this create very big problem for me . So @AmazonSupport I want you to look into to the matter either replace it or return this since it is in warranty period to the Samsung company this product as early as possible.
"Fingerprint sensor is really bad as compared to the rear sensor in other mi phones.
Battery charging is awesome, and battery life is good.
Camera is excellent and size of picture is very large."

Camera quality is too good. Specially the 32 MP selfie camera is just a beast.

Battery optimization is not that good.

One thing that attracts me is that the size of the phone. It is compact enough, you can use in one hand comfortably.

Runs smoothly.

Got Android 10 update just yesterday.
Its good.

Stock android experience is good enough. But misses some featured phone facilities of MIUI at the same time.

Display quality is good enogh. You can not find out any drawback of 720p at all.

One main drawback is that, the monthly updates are given too late. They provide it in the last weak of the month.

Also the android 10 they have given in March 2020, where Nokia devices got that update probably in last november.

XIAOMI R&D team is just useless.
They put there whole brain in feature phones.

Also, the Xiaomi official made some fake promises like they will give android 10 update first in MI A3.

No lag till date.

P. S: I am not a gamer. 😑

I will recommend you to buy Nokia Stock Android phones for their better service.

Only you can go for MI A3 if you want excellent camera."
"""naam bde darshan chhote ""
if you buying this for AndroidOne then please dnt go for this . screen at their worse fingerprint sensor really slow n disappointing . display quality not worthy .

Evrything is explaining very well about this phone only one thing is hide. I had buy this phone 3+32gb but when i see about internal memory of this phone is showing me only 21gb instead of 32 gb that time i fill cheated. Bettry is also little cause for this phone beacuse its take more time to charge full with 18w fast charger... what the hell is thiss🤔 if you want to buy this phone atleast go for mobile shop and check how much take time to charge full and see the memory.

Over all good performance on the phone usage after two days of delivery. Fingerprint sensor response is good and descent battery back up.
"Finally happened to get my hands on the device.. feels very premium in hand. Display is very much near to amoled.. rear cameras are good for this price. Back glass is on par with OnePlus as I'm using even 7t I really can't differentiate the quality..
Cons: Volume from the speaker is not so impressive.. & ufff... Flash sales.. big disappointment for many mi fans who are waiting to get there hand on the device..
Thank you..."
Please guys don't buy this worst mobile. Samsung and Amazon cheating the people.

Pros,
1. Batter life is good
2. Most of the Samsung feature available fo less budget.

Cons,
1.Camera performance is average"
All is okay
"Thr fingerprint and face scanners work like tortoise and the phone wont work as they showing
-they are not accepting refunding  aslo
BETTER NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE"
Apart from battery nothing is great.. ok for the price
"Here's a review of the phone after a week's usage:
The phone looks great and is a sweet deal considering the price point. Xiaomi has made a few improvements like putting a fast charger in the box. The phone has been running smooth so far and performing well as far as gaming is concerned. Here are the features:

1. Awesome design- the phone looks good and the color scheme is fresh. The water drop notch looks good and the bezels are pretty sleek. The fingerprint reader is smaller as well.
2.  Display - The FHD+ display has 2340*1080 resolution, the color reproduction is good and viewing angles are nice. Sharpness levels are okay I would say.
3. Performance - The Snapdragon 655 processor with Adreno 610 GPU does a very smooth job as far as using the apps are concerned. I never faced a lag or a stutter so far. The MIUI is as usual and I have never personally liked it. Let's hope the MIUI11 rollout makes things better. Gaming experience is decent and not very great. But considering the price , the expectations weren't that high.
4. Camera - Camera does a decent job. At this price point , the front camera is outperforming. The rear camera does a decent job as well. It could have been better though.  The ultrawide lens serves its purpose. But comparing it with other phones under 20k, they all do a similar job.
5. Battery - The battery lasts a full day with above moderate usage that includes browsing social media for 1-2 hours, streaming videos for 3-4 hours, using WhatsApp web for 8-9 hours. The device takes around one hour to get from 20% to 80%.

Verdict - The phone looks good, performs well and takes decent pictures. It's a total value for money and would prove to be  a good competitor in the mid range segment."
Phone is getting switch off automatically.facing lots of issue for that.

I bought galaxy m31 after seeing YouTube reviews..... now only I found that they all are paid reviews...😌😌🙄🙄🙄

If you want a complete phone, please  choose any another brand like redmi, realme or something else

I am not satisfied with this phone...

"Dropping down to three stars ... On a recent visit, I saw TWO roaches on the main floor of the restaurant. No one seemed to care, so I got up and stepped on one.  I pointed out the other, and one of the staff killed it, but they didn't seem surprised.  I know that roaches are hard to control, but having two of them wandering about in a busy restaurant just isn't a good thing. 

Also, our waiter was an overly chatty guy who seems to think we are interested in his voice.  They had some good staff in the past, but I suspect the owner, who likes to get drunk and hang out on the patio, gives me the impression of a guy who would be difficult to work for! 

The food is still decent and better than anything else I've found, but I'm looking for alternatives ..."

I have purchase Samsung M20 4gb ram only one month before on 15th July.But this new mobile have started hanging and display is showing dark line when I used mobile and also one black spot is shows permanently.Finally I want to replace my mobile. What I have to please guide
I live in north Phoenix and believe me there needs to be a lot more quality dining out here. This is a gem. The atmosphere is tops. The food is consistent. The management actually cares. It's just a cool place all the way around! A lot of corporate establishments seem to yank popular things off the menu cause it's just not trendy anymore. Every single thing I have had at this place was delicious! Not one other restaurant has pulled that off. A place you can actually count on for a good evening. High five to the Yard house!
Display got demeged in just one month
Not met my expectation. the call quality is terrible. Camera is just ok.
This product is not Delebered today
"I read quite a few reviews on Yelp prior to checking this place out with a group of 10 or so.  We arrived and the table wasn't ready just yet - we ordered a variety of cocktails, menu driven cocktails, beer and wine. I had an 8th Street Ale - always a good choice.  I had to ask for a cold glass to put it in and when I was served the 2nd one, they didn't include it. I had to ask again.

The food:  Pretty good, actually. However, its totally overpriced and the portions are pretty small. So it makes the hurt on the wallet that much more severe.  Our waitress was cool, she put up with a lot of conversations in our group, sometimes being loud and not paying attention.

I would go back again, but most likely for lunch. Hopefully you would get the same size meal for a few bucks less.  By the way, I had the pasta with rib eye in it (I forget the name) and my wife had the Carbonara.  They were both good!"
Camera quality is not good.. fingerprint is good and smooth.. battery life is long
Operating profit rose to EUR 9.2 mn from EUR 6.8 mn in the corresponding period in 2007 .
Poor built quality!
"I purchased Samsung Galaxy M20 last month from amazon. Just one month passed and we started noticing that battery discharges very fast as well as if we operate the mobile for 5mins, the mobile becomes extremely hot.
I don't blame supplier/vendor it's completely amazons responsibility to provide at least a good mobile to customer.
I had a big doubt on the products originality.
The supplier /vendor of such products as well as amazon should stop delivering nonsense products to customers."
Worst phone .. not worth to buy . Bought it today only from store .. fooled by store salesmen . Worst battery worst camera . 23000 wasted
It's very bad mobile..camera is not good..
Amazing screen....finger print reader is good...but it placed a bit higher...camera is good...not fantastic....u may get phone with better configuration but I always give importance to sar rating...it's sar rating is low...and it is manufactured in India....so far no lagging....value for money... recommended...
"Picture quality is avarage. Sound quality is very low and Battery life is worst ever.
Charging and headphones connecting system is very very worst.
Do not waste money on this phone."
Very good battery backup
"It's been a few months since I've been here, and what a change, not for the better. I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.

The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.

Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more."
Worst product.. Don't buy it.. Kept on hanging again and again.. After few days I got this product
Worst battery
"don`t think that went well, was only in there for 15 mins"
Everything is just fine except the battery life. Battery is 4000mAh. A battery life of 5000mAh or more would have added an extra star to the product.
"Worst phone ever seen....Voice is breaking whenever we speak on phone. Got replaced with new Samsung M20 but still facing the same issue.

Pathetic support by Amazon team as well. Not ready to refund my amount"
"No value for money. Software is sloppy. Not enough features in phone, seems like using old phone. Camera is useless, Wide capture doesn't work properly, zooming is worst, however selfie is just OK nothing much. Phone heats up like microwave. Display is cool. OS is not upto the Mark. ViVo claims it's ""Funtouch OS"", but actually it's totally ""F*ed Up OS"". However the only good thing about phone is that it just looks good from outside, but under the hood it's totally Useless. ViVo Ruined it."
Samung m31 is impressive mobile tha battery life of the mobile is super and the cam quality also impressive but the fingerprint sensor and face unlock is little bit slower than others
The phone is heating while use.Not a good decision to buy it.It is heating at the top and from back and front area.One can't hold it in the hand. Poor phone.
: You MUST watch Grey`s. It was their 100th episode. Let me know once you do. I don`t want to give out any more details

"It's a good phone but honestly I loved my 5t more 😊

There was a lot of heating issues initially but after an update looks like it's fixed.

Overall one plus never disappoints 👍👍"
Thanks to amazon. The product was returned because the speaker was not working properly. And they said to me to try book on next sale.
Value for money at this price range.

As per Amazon app, the box will have headset along with other accessories, when I purchased one, found that headset is missing so I went for replacement. Even the replacement box doesn't have headset.

Think twice"
Proximity sensor is the worst quality possible in this phone ... all other things are top quality
The sellers were the founders of the company .
"This phone is good but the Samsung software is irritating one. You will find lit of adds popping up again and again. Camera is mediocre. Touch screen is not that much sensitive, some times it will miss your instructions.

But guys battery is superb. It longs full day means once in 24 hours only you need to charge it. I am using the net through out the day but still the battery so robust that it never shows need for charging."
"Oh, It's nice,trust me just go for it.Its fast smooth.the speaker, display is crisp and clear, camera is tolerable.over all an excellent phone.oxygen is fast.good built quality.

1. you can switch on internet only on one sim and if you want to switch to another sim you need to manually disable it in settings.
2. Vibration is not working after update!
3. Wifi not connecting easily, needs two or three attempts to connect.
4. Screen is worst , i thought it will be bearable but even icons are not readable."
Very good model from Samsung
"Camera quality thoda or achha hota to thik tha ye mobile

Best Smartphone under 10000
Camera quality is poor and bettry backup also disappointed as per 5000MAH

Honestly saying don't buy this phone. Ringtone is very slow. Camera disappointed. Loud speaker is very very very very poor. Total waste of money. Go for another one. Waste of money.

"Worst phone ihave ever used touch is not working properly pls don't buy in Amazon ,there is no return or refund policy but they tell us  in the app like easy return.dont be fool

Useless technicians, they don't give proper information and said install smart check app to test your phone and that app is also programmed for giving result like that phone is in good condition

Body structure is also not good it's like a plastic toy, the edges also not sealed properly totally waste of money😡😡😡"

"We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not comp'd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the ""we can't provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record"" line.

Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told ""he's out of town."" The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized."
Hi
"My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Don't do it, you will regret it!"
Yes
Not satisfied with it..and it does not even meet the expectation...in this price i think it is not the correct phone to buy...and after i purchased it the price decreased up to 2000 within 20 days...
Phone is beautiful but camera quality is not so good as they claimed 48mp... Not hood for selfie lovers
only an hour left with my iPod touch
Excellent Phone at this price rate. Camera is fantastic. Music Display everything is better.
Good Phone with latest features within budget
Nice product 👍
if you can't compromise with camera go for it otherwise battery is draining very fast. No lasting for one day of normal uses.

Really this phone is awesome!! Go for it..
Most likely
"Great phone under ₹10k. Since I'm a redmi fan, I've always considered them to provide good phones at reasonable prices. Apart from its good specifications at this price point, addition of a dedicated micro SD card for expandable storage space requirement as well as introducing blue screen technology for viewing purpose has really impressed me. Good going RN8 from Xiaomi."

"Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly ""side dish"" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said ""he"" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night."

Very Good mobile for this price

"Battery life is amazing with fast charging capabilities, now I don't like any phone with less then 5000 mph. Camera quality is good but require upgradation, on same range advanced camera is available with different brands. No issues with fingerprint reader but if it will be available on screen then it will be value added. I was looking for another phone but after analysis concluded that this is better as of now with similar price range. I am looking for upgraded version of M30. Overall happy with product with reasonable price range."

The AMOLED display is excellent.
Great battery life.
Samsung gave no compromise on camera quality.
The wide angle lens is just amazing.
The fingerprint sensor has not been upto the mark.But I don't find it difficult.
The other thing is that it is not a gaming phone.
But games work fine in moderate mode.
In my opinion this is one of the best smartphone below Rs20,000.
I also recommended this phone to my cousin and he uses it."
"Super Smart phone

Software very bad
Camera keep stopping not opening
Posting the review after using the M20 for six months. No camera is ok. Battery does not last as expected. Also if you use any type of phone cover then the phone overheats during charging.
Worest phone never buy it

"I can give overall 3.5 star for this.
Internet connectivity is slow when compared to mi mobile, checked with same sim in both the devices.
Front camera is not that good considering 8 mp produces too much smooth artificial images of faces for selfies. Back camera is good enough.
Battery backup and charging is the most plus point and best point of the phone.
Device should have been more thinner and lighter would be great."

Battery back up good but camera clearity not good don't buy
Fingerprint does not support after one month use....once in 5 times it accepts...camera quality is average.
"Don't buy phone only to see camera performance. Phone activity performance is most important & this phone is very slow in operation, finger sensor is very slow, dailer screen is very slow & also heating issue.
Over all it is worst phone of samsung. Don't buy."

"We went to Ocean Prime the other night and it was delicious.  I don't know if it was worth the money but it was definitely good.  The setting is as attractive as any restaurant I can remember, with classical contemporary decor and a very cool display of alcohol bottles in the bar.

I was in a party of seven and the prevalent dish was the bone-in filet.  We had heard it was better than the steakhouses in Chicago.  Well I'm from Chicago, and trust me, you get a better (and bigger) bone-in filet at Joe's.  But it was still a delicious steak.  The sides were terrific and the salads were good too.  But those prices!  Wow, value is not this restaurant's strong suit.

About the only other thing I'll add is the service was below average, a concern considering what the prices were like.  Our server tried hard but he was too slow and didn't get our order right."
Everything is 100% to my expectations in this price range.

"I'm reviewing this product after using for a week..It is absolutely an beast in this price segment..One thing about Samsung is that..Its super amoled display,security and build  ...

-SOFTWARE:8.5/10
The new OneUI 2.0 built on Android 10 is superb and user friendly..Also it has some good features

-DISPLAY:9/10
The 6.4inch amoled display  with full-HD+ is good...It supports Widevine L1 to which is awesome..The details were richer compared to other mobiles in this price segment

-BATTERY:10/10
The massive 6000mah is pretty good and it lasts upto 1.5 days for a normal user .Charging from 0-75% is good with 15W charger but after it takes a long time to reach 100% ..
Total time taken (0-100%) is 2.5 hrs..

-SOUND:9/10
The sound is decent..it has richer tone and no distortion at high volumes...The Dolby Atmos supports only with Earphones  but it was excellent. Call quality was good..

-CAMERA:7.5/10
As this model is just an upgraded version of m30s,it is just have been improved...The pics came out well in daylight..dynamic range was pretty decent....But video stabilization and photos at low light was not upto the mark..Macro was okayish...The front camera was okay ..But overall good..

-It is not suitable  for high graphics  gaming...
Overheating is not there...I suggest Samsung  to upgrade  the chipset in the future
-Fingerprint reader is very fast
-Phone is slippery..I suggest you to buy a good case for it."

Because,This is good phone in mid range and when you keep in hand you feels premium comparative to other brands.
From the day I buy this phone I have no problem to handle it because it runs very smoothly.
》The key specifications of Samsung M20 are:
1)Sharp, crisp display
2)Good battery life
3)Up-to-date specifications
4)And you get regular software updates from samsung."
"Heating problem, sound is very low, bad product"
It`s Star Wars day?! Urgh I`m gonna have to get the videos out
Best phone in this range . Having the best battery life . 5000 mAh is something. Playing games on this phone is the best feeling. It has good storage with good camera Making my photos come live . Has a clear and crisp screen.
"Plenty has already been spoken about hardware and specs so no point getting into that. This is a user centric review

Face and fingerprint unlock is good.

Funtouch OS is childish and cluttered. Lot of settings are provided just for the sake of being 'different' but the overall effect ends up being counter intuitive - for example swiping up for screenshot rather than down. Taking a long screenshot and/ or creating a split screen is unnecessarily complicated with requirement of more taps rather than being a simple affair as in other OS skins. Swiping up for accessing control center shortcuts is an irritant as it sometimes brings up the 'recent apps' screen or the 'docked apps' if using a custom launcher.

The camera UI can do with a complete makeover and as such is rudimentary compared to other mobiles! The only saving grace is that the cam2api is compatible with open camera which bestows more control over the photography. The camera and sensor performance is at par with mobiles of this price point category.

No complaints with the screen, system performance and battery charging/ backup.

Phone self test feature is missing.

The updates (have received one update so far) install without change log information - go figure!!!

A major point of angst is the misleading paid reviews which claimed the Phone has FM radio. However, in actual fact the phone does not ship with the FM radio chip (Also confirmed from the support staff, who - just to mention - were found to be clueless regarding the difference between an internet FM radio and actual terrestrial FM radio. They kept insisting to install any FM app from google play store - Go figure!!!

All in all a mixed bag - some good - rest mostly just hype!!! In my personal opinion, such a mobile is overpriced at this price point even with the deals thrown in. Would probably avoid patronizing Vivo products in future!"

Camera quality is not good and the major issue is phone get heat up in 5 min of call
I can't use 2nd sim if I have not switched data with it.  I must have to use data with 2nd sim to get network connectivity. That's a bit disappointment and there's a problem with earphones also. The volume automatically reduces without even touching the phone. I'm way too disappointed with the purchase. I got the phone exchanged though the issues ain't resolved.

Nice mobile
not that great ! moible gets hanged on very first day !

Camera quality is superb.. battery life is also good. The main issue with this phone is the fingerprint lock. It doesn't work sometimes.
Sometime I have to touch things more than once

"Fingerprint very good
Camera quality required improvement
Battery life just ok"
"MiA2 is a disaster! The company tried to make a stock android phone but guess their engineers were not equipped to do the job. The phones software is not compatibile with the hardware and this results in the below mentioned issues:-
1. Major lag issues on using different aps
2. Shuts down randomly and refuses to boot again
3. Occasionally hangs and becomes non responsive

The company should ideally take back all the phone from the market and rework on it. I would have given a 0 rating to the phone but giving atleast 1 rating is a criteria."

I got my product delivered to me after 4-5 days of its sale which is quite disappointing. After 2-3 hour of usage I found that its speakers are below average. My 2 year old redmi note 4 speakers are giving it tough fight and it doesn't end just here. It's screen was unresponsive to touch for a while. I had to shut it off by holding power button. After considering all aspects I will say xiaomi hasn't learned from its mistakes.
Best phone .battery life very good.

A premium looking phone in a budget range.. if you want a phone which has a good camera along with bigger battery and powerful processor then m30 is the one ... It has a quick fingerprint unlock and face unlock is also faster.

"All I'm saying is they need to do a better job at hiring their staff. The girl that helped us out last time was on something pretty heavy. It was a school night, and we had just finished up dinner next door at Windsor. We all wanted to get something sweet, but the girl working there was so blitzed out of her mind on something. She was barely able to interact with us. Within the first 2 minutes she must have asked us 5 times how we were doing. She never once made eye contact.  I'm not exaggerating by saying she looked pretty filthy, and was really rude to boot. Maybe that's just how the poor girl is, but damn, you think they could do a better job hiring people to compliment the charm of a family oriented cutesy sweet spot. 

She turned us off so bad, that no one in the party decided to order anything.

I give it 3 stars because I've been before, and thought their stuff  was good, not great. Churn is pretty damn adorable & local, so they get extra love for that. So, for now, until something better comes along it will just have to do."

"During first week I feel that the range in which they are offering is really great device, but in next week it changed my view as some part of screen suddenly stopped responding. Initially I thought it might be software issue but the problem grows as it was not happening for a single application but for all. But glad enough that service center quickly fixed issue by replacing screen. But still this kind of defect occuring in such short time frame seems the quality control might not be up to expectation."
Everything is fine but little bit battery backup not so great
I got the phone yesterday. When i switched kn the phone it is overheated. When i call order for an replacement they said that they wouldn't replace the phone.

"My favorite place for fish fry. They perfectly pour pints of Guinness, too.

The ginormous chunks of cod with a crispy, light-to-medium batter is very tasty. I prefer it with the scalloped potatoes but you don't get a choice during Friday all-you-can-eat.

It's a small-to-medium sized pub with a nice scotch and whiskey menu. I had my first Tullamore Dew here and it didn't disappoint. It's a bit dark and some of the tables are wine barrels - makes comfortable sitting a bit of a challenge. The live bands I've heard were great and can be pretty loud. A couple of TVs dot the bar with all things football (soccer) and American football (if you're a Jets fan).

Service is friendly and only a couple of times it wasn't very prompt.

It definitely has a bit of character to it and I wish I had more time to stop by there."

Once you add some hot sauce to that it equals one of the best burritos in town.  I learned of this only because of one of the employees telling me to get it this way because all the people that work there eat it this way.  You have to try it!"

Camera is only best at where there is light.battery doest act like a 6000 mah.coz when playing pubg it drains unlikely faster.but overall phone is pretty much fast not lags nothing.in light I must say camera is a beast. But for 14k its value for money with less SAR.
"From the very first day camera was not working, it always hangs. After 35 days app were also hanging then I show it to mi center , they reboot it lets see how it works."
Nice phone
Morning all .. just into the office now
"Hanging problem and software also.
By mistakely brought this phone. After return period completed, I am facing the above problems."
"Phone is very good.. its bang for buck..
Pros
1. Solid built
2. Solid battery life
3. Solid display
4. Solid charging speed
5. Comes with 18w fast charger
6. Speaker and ear piece quality is excellent
7. Case provided with black model is superb
Cons
1. Cant play heavy games
2. Finger print reader works a bit slow but its accurate
3. Some times proximity sensor does not function properly
4. Dust and finger print magnet that too dust gets collected easily in the camera bump

But overall its solid.. you wont regret buying it"
Nice and slim phone with good features at this price range.
Overall experience is good except the fast charging and battery life.. medium budget and brand name
This mobile is bed.  I want to return this mobile

"The port operator , however , favors retaining the port fees in 2010 , citing the owner , the governemtn of Estonia , commiting the port to pay EEK 400mn ( EUR 25.56 mn USD 36.44 mn ) in dividends to the state in 2009 and another EEK 300mn in 2010 ."

"I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks and the battery feels like 3000mAh at best.

I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.

I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.

Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.

Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints here

Camera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality"
"Hi guys
 please don't buy this phone it's camera quality is so so so so ooooo  poor  there are better options available in the market  pls go for a better phone  don't fall for it's ratings  it has got camera and processing issues.।। It"
Fingerprint sensor is very fast camera also great in price range battery 6000mh is very good
Good product but not best
Its awesome
Speaker is not working and camera quality is getting worst
"just woke up..busy busy busy 2day...bake bbyshower cupcakes and jays bday cake, bleach hair again & see my boo"
Bought 3 Samsung M30's in the last 6 months for each member of my family ! Amazing battery life. I charge it once and don't have to charge it for atleast 2 days..! Its got almost all features of a high end phone at such an amazing price. I am truly happy with this phone. Samsung never disappoints.
Everything is fine but I am not happy with phone. For everything you need to install app. It's better to use custom ui based phone
Performance is very worst experience
"Battery life is awesome
Games when played on high ratio lags sometimes
Fingerprint reader sometimes takes time more than usual"
"wroste phone its hanging to the core
and restarting automatically per hour
dont buy this phone"
Redmi note 8 is good product according to price. But its camera not good as expected. We can't shoot pics from far. And picture quality is not good according to 48 mp camera.
And that 's exactly what happened on a recent weekday when an East Haven baker was brought in to remind residents about the Easter tradition of making wheat and rice pies .
I think it’s the most efficient phone for the price range camera quality is very good and also the face unlock works perfect couldn’t ask for more at this price
Supper se v upper
"I had an awesome experience here and highly recommend Dr. Dachs. He is here to be a good dentist, not just to get rich. His hygienist was a rock star: So nice and very gentle. I nearly fell asleep during the cleaning.

I found my way to this practice after a horrible experience at another dentist just half a mile away (see my review of Belmont Dentistry on Raintree). Dr. Dachs was just so helpful and reassuring while still maintaining a very high level of professionalism. I am very thankful that my ""second opinion"" quest led me to him. I now finally have a top-quality dentist in Scottsdale I can trust!

I definitely recommend selecting this practice. It may take a little time to get in, but it's worth it. They also work well with insurance."
Camera not good
I bought this phone and I can say it's the best phone I have ever bought..it comes with best camera..best battery life..best display..best touch sensitivity..very slim and over its best..plz buy it if you really want to buy brand and features at this amazing price.. loving it

Allover phone is good. But sometimes it's hunged Like hell.. Ram is not enough
"Thats charger is not good only just 16th  days  charger is not working properly I thik I got

Go for redmi if you of purchasing under 12k
Front camera clarity was not good
Camera quality poor
"Great mobile,but I don't like it phone Design..."

"DISPLAY OF SAMSUNG GALAXY M 31 IS VERY LOVELY , VERY SMOOTH TO HANDLING, VALL THINGS ARE VERY GOOD LIKE SOUND, CAMERA, DISPLAY, LIGHT WAIGHT, OVERALL SAMSUNG GALAXY M 31 MOBILE  IS VALUE FOR MONEY."
Bad performance
Camera not upto the mark
Sometimes phone is getting auto reboot
Watching **** & The City at my brothers soccer game. I have totally defited the purpose of coming.. Hehe
"The good: nice place, nice service. nice experience. 
As all have mentioned before, interesting and delicious wine selections and bruschetta to die for [I am a fan of the proscuitto/fig/marscarpone and the smoked salmon]. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. 

The bad: okay, the not-so-good...hideous parking [but there's a $3 valet] and really loud. Interesting vibe and a mixed crowd. Would bet its great when the weather cools down and patio seating is more appealing that the current August sauna. 

All in all, I'd go back, eat. drink. eat some more."

"Awesome product with all the latest functionality

My phone does not work in the DONS
Awesome mobile....I got it for ₹7200 best budget phone from samsung
Good
"Outstanding product.

Pros:
1. Outstanding rear and front cameras. Pics attached using all modes night mode pro mode 48mp cam, night mode and macro mode
2. Top battery. 4000 maH Lithium Polymer battery gives the necessary backup for essential activities. For a non gamer like me, battery runs close to two days with moderate internet usage. For heavy gamers and high internet usage users, battery will last one full day.
3. Very few ads on the MiUI 10 which is a big relief. Plus they can be turned off as well.
4. Stable Android 9 with a possibility of Android 10 uodate. MiUI is pretty stable too.
5. Loads of storage space around 110 GB free space out of 128 GB. You can literally full up your mobile and use this this like a mini hard disk.
6. Powerful 6 GB RAM. Multitasking is pretty simple and I have tested this personally by opening 15 apps in congruence. The performance did not come down even one bit.
7. Inbuilt RAM cleaner and security scan check. New apps are automatically scanned for viruses.
8. Great camera with a variety of features including slow motion video (1080p) macro mode night mode 48 MP mode pro mode potrait mode with depth focus. Shots are clear and crisp. Good night mode shots illustrated in the pics.
9. Gorilla glass 5 on both sides of the phone to protect fall and both sides smooth finish. This is an enhancement feature which wasn't present earlier.
10. Fantastic Snapdragon 665 processor with a decent 100000+ Antutu score. Excellent for daily usage and good for gaming.
11. Great 6+ inch display perfect for normal day to day use.
12. No issue of heating encountered until now in 15 days of usage.
13. 18 watt fast charging makes the phone go from 0 to 100 charger in less than an hour which is simply brilliant.

Cons:

1. Battery would be a downfall for gamers as it drains faster on gaming.
2. Snapdragon 665 might not be the accurate choice for gaming. Helio processor on the Redmi  note 8 pro is a true gaming beast.
3. Selfie camera of 13 MP has limited options. Only HD and AI to be specific. Could have provided multiple options on the front cam or enhanced it's quality but for 13k this is a killer deal.
4. Ads in the interface can be irritating for new users.
5. Phone gets heated on charging which I guess is pretty normal for any phone.

Go for it. It will not disappoint you. Best budget phone."
Some times it was stucking like poor quality
Good
"Pros-
Battery life
Front and back Camera

Cons-

HaHa i Forgot...It`ll Probably Be On Youtube...So I`ll Watch It Later
"I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. 

The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  

As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    

My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  

oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.  

Tommy Bahama and I just didn't work out at all."

"Good Battery , Excellent Camera especially the Night Scape 2.0 , Best Display and Audio in the Segment - Totally worth the Money"
"As I was using other MI products. This product is not having inbuilt - call recording, call log history, SMS management, inbuilt Truecaller, single button screenshot, inbuilt app lock, dual app, theme selection, widgets options, gallery, etc"
"Likes light weight, picture clarity,

Dislike is battery backup very very less,camera said 20MP but actually looks like 8mp and rear camera physically projected than its surface so definitely camera will damage or scratches happened on cemara glass first."

Worst phone ever please don't buy after 1 year I am rating this worst it hangs too much Samsung is making its phone slow through update
just for a little while.. to get an impression of how twitter-copy-topify
"Waste of money is the word. Hopeless phone. I have been struggling with it for over a month now. The first function of a phone is to make calls and that only you can't do with this phone. Half the time it shows not registered on network and half the time you can't hear the other side. Whereas other brand phone working on same network in same area work fine. Battery is good but that serves no purpose if you can't make calls. It's an engineering disaster , I don't know how samsung clears such products. Pls don't waste your money on this and more so invite multiple problems. I have downloaded all latest software patches so those who would defend it by saying pls download latest software patch, pls maintain distance.Stay away from it and save your money and mental peace."

"Fingerprint reader is excellent, camera quality is perfect when we compare with other budget phones it is better,And Nothing to say about battery life.. Battery life is the best thing in this phone. Thank you Samsung 😍"
Completely disappointed with this mobile. Used Realme and xiomi before but this time my mind was not working so I bought  M30s. Network issue in all M30s mobile.  So many features are not there. You have to rely on third party app. Disgusting.

The phone has completely shut down and is not charging from the past 3 days. I had the phone delivered on 13th June 2019 and it switched off on 27th May 2019.
I am hoping proper action will be taken."
"I use this mobile for more than 2months,it's smoothly running,but sometimes i face some minor issues,.it's ok
It runs pubg smoothly without lag,it's worth."
Overall it is good. But in photography section the photos appears bit noisy.
Touch is smooth.  Battery is good.  Camera is not that great. Overall it's a good phone for 12000
"Itz a goood phone
Specs are not bad
Cam quality seems to be lil colurfull,doesn't loooks natural photos,processor is good, battery lyf is good,only the bad thing for me is the cam quality.others all are good compared to the rate below."
Nice one.So far
"So I bought this one and returned it another day! Reason was a very simple one... Camera was not at all clear and it had a fault that my fingerprint scanner was loose and was moving in and out on pressing.
So just got it exchanged!

Battery life was good enough
Camera -(1/5)
Fingerprint - Maybe good one but mines was just a faulty piece."

Anyways...I adore this place.  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.  It is nuts!  Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!  This place can never go wrong!  The orange and fennel salad it amazing!  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!  I often get this salad through out the week.  I love the kale and quinoa salad too!  It is my go to salad.  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.  I wish I could get enough but I cannot!  The ambiance is awesome! Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.  The parking is difficult, but you expect that since it is so popular!  Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!  OMG OMG OMG!!  There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!  I try to refuse every time but I cannot.  I really enjoy the sangria.  The wine selection is great!  I just love this place!!!!"

All over product is good but battery drains too fast
"I'm a Sprint customer so maybe I'm biased. I'll just say that upfront.

I got another phone on my plan and had no problems. At all.

Once I told the salesperson that I lost my connection cable for my BB 8330, he gave me one free.

Score.

Though, minus one star for not being a repair store."
Worth it to the T
Nice to use
It was not a nice product
"It's touch is not working smoothly, also finger print reader response is slow..
Camera and Battery service is Good"

Well the battery is good it takes 1 and half hour to get charged completely.
Yes there are heating issue while phone is getting  charged.
Camera pixel is never 48 pixel you just a very low quality image.
Front camera quality is worse.
So with this price there are better smartphones in the market.
And things phone has a problem of delayed touch and also it hangs very quite often which makes ram poor."
Camera not good specially Portrait feature is useless. Screen getting locked even when phone is in use

Best parts are:
Screen
Camera
Sound
Call quality
Weight
Battery"

"Good food, good service, good price, shitty location.

I had the carne asada plate which came with guac, beans, and corn tortillas.  The tortillas were amazing, the carne asada was above average, as were the beans.  Unfortunately, as good as it was, it's still Mexican food.  Not that I have anything against Mexican food, it just, for the most part, all tastes similar.  Nothing really stood out as AMAZING.  If I'm in the area (god forbid), I'll def. eat there again, but I'm not going to drive from the E. Valley to go here.  Bonus points for having 7-Up in a bottle, made with sugar."

"Phone is okay for the price. There is a slight heating problem, more than usual for smartphones. Anybody who has owned a smartphone knows that every phone heats up on extensive gaming and wifi use.
My problem was that the Charger Adapter that came with the handset was faulty, didn't work. Amazon said the whole item had to be replaced but i was fine with the phone. Xiaomi has a lot of ground to cover and offer better services to its customers and better products."
"The all new Samsung M20 is a great mobile with combination of various things...whether we speak abt its light weight body or the camera quality. The camera is a standout and helps to take great selfies as well as wide angle photographs. Moreover, its battery life is just so amazing. The battery easily lasts for a day and helps me do multi tasking as well as enjoy all kinds of entertainment.The great display helps is a great add on. It is hugeee, and it is great to view videos, movies on the large screen! This is surely one of the top phones!"

Best camera phone. Sound quality is ok because only one speaker but two speaker point. Battery life is worst. Heating mobile while charging. Some internal problem also there. Not worth for 15000 to 20000.

Product doesn't contain headphone although it was mentioned in product description. Fast charging is not there. My other phone which is not support fast charging but this phone with so called having fast charging take more time than my other phone.
Someone who has been using phone in sub 5k to 8k where phone specs are below normal the trend and wish to upgrade. Then this phone can be a best bet. Redmi offers quality phones at amazingly low price especially when you compare with phones which are out there at above 15k to upto a 50k or to a even a lac. So it's good.

Very good product
One of the best phone in the budget. Form factor is good.
Look and display is good but camera is pretty bad. Also performance is slow. Specifications are just number game here so don't trust it.

"Video recordings have lags when played. When I work on my mobile, suddenly the app closes and any random app pops up out of no where. It automatically switch to second space, though phone has latest features but I think there are many other options in the market at same price range. I'm disappointed.
One more thing, sometimes internet signals are too weak to work with but at the same time when I work on my other mobile signals work better.......I thought it's a successor to redmi note 7 pro but it's a degradation"

Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB.

"Starting from saying it’s loveeeeee
Getting such a huge screen at this price is all we ever asked for!!
Full screen of the mobile gives out a joy for using it. Then comes the vibrant colours! The colours of the different beautiful wallpaper looks amazing! There is a huge range of options for wallpapers too!
Phones are very necessary for today’s generation hence choosing a good phone was important and I guess I did a great job by choosing a wonderful phone like M20
It’s also thin enough with a sleek body
It comes in two classy colours!
Infinity display is my favourite part of the phone.
Battery is also good as it comes with 5000mah battery
It also gets charged very fast 3x
It comes with 4gb ram with freaking 64gb internal
It’s also a dual sim phone the way everyone needs in nowadays business life
Now comes the best part! And that camera!
One and all needs a good camera this phone satisfies that need in a really really good manner!!!
It’s a dual camera!
It also comes with front flash! Say hello to night selfies!
Portrait mode of this phone is worth melting for!
Once again this phone is loveeeee
Really enjoying using it the touch is really amazing 🤩"

"This place has great food - some of the best ""bar"" food around. But you really go for the beer. It's a brewery, right? 

I haven't tried a beer I didn't like here. There should be one that fits your taste, even if you're not a big beer drinker. The prices are reasonable and even better during happy hour which has two convenient times during the day (regular and reverse). If you're unfamiliar with the beer choices try a sampler and then grab a pint of your favorite!"

Totally waste
"First of all they say it's a 15w fast charger. But it took a whopping, 3.5 hrs to charge from 0% to 100%. SUPERAMOLED?. WHEN I PLACED MY LENOVO K8 NOTE NEXT TO THIS PHONE AND WATCHED SONY TEN1 HD ON BOTH OF THEM THE CLARITY WAS MUCH BETTER IN K8 WHICH IS A TFT WITH FULL HD AND NOT SUPERAMOLED.
THE NETWORK SIGNAL ON MY AIRTEL SIM IN THIS MOB HAS ONLY 2 STICKS WHEN OTHER OLDER PHONES HAVE 3/4 STICKS WHEN PLACED NEXT TO EACH OTHER.
THIS PHONE IS ONLY SELLING FOR ITS 6000 MAH BATTERY..... STILL NOT SEEN THE BATTERY LIFE."
"It comes with a brand of Samsung and live up to its expectations. Excellent battery back up, super fast processor. Apt for someone who use it for watching online content and day to day usage of social media. I don't play games so not sure but looks like it will work well for games as well."
"It has been more than 15 days I am using the phone, battery backup is good, speed is good,but the 📷 camera is really amazing..
It is really worth for money.."
Good
"Good dual camera.
Battery heats up during charging or while playing games.
There is no seperate 3.5mm port. One has to use either c type cable or a converter. Converter is provided with the phone."

My homemade potato salad was not seasoned-loved the texture, but had to add salt&pepper for any flavor. A few ""quotes"" written on the walls was part of the decor.

Picture quality looks awesome I don't think I used camera that well there are useful specifications for camera
Selfie not good at night times
Gaming is simply awesome
While playing games it will get heating problem but after 5 minutes it gets cool down thanks for liquid cooling technology
For me it looks awesome"
Phone is best in battery but the camera but the camera quality of phone is too poor
"Absolutely, positively bitter. They use a powder in lieu of syrups which adds a after taste I don't care for.

There was no color difference between my beverage (latte) and my friends (iced coffee). Why... I have no clue. We order these drinks everywhere and this has never happened before.

I can see how a powder would be more cost effective but the taste was something I did not care for.

Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure."

"My husband and I were in the Staples parking lot, looking for somewhere to eat.  I popped up my trusty Yelp app and found this place, about 30 feet from where I was parked.  It's pretty unassuming from outside, but what an amazing dining experience.  Not only is the food amazing (well, of course--you make it exactly how you like it!) but the portions are such that you should be able to get two meals out of it.  In general, this is a healthy alternative to fast food and an eating experience that your whole family will enjoy.  We plan to take our out of town guests here when they come to visit."
Mobile is perfect package of budget price range...but camera  quality is not impressive.
"Mobile do not meet the declared quality by company not only by display but also in battery. Camera is the most worst highlighted part of this model. I previously used note 7 pro which 48 MP camera is much more better than this model 64 MP camera.
I must suggest, don't go for this model as there are lots of better mobile is available at market within this price range."

"For the price, this phone offers a great combination of good camera and battery life. This phone has all the basic requirements covered like dual SIM+expandable memory slot which seems to be a luxury nowadays with other companies opting for hybrid slots, Type-C connector + Fast charging, a headphone jack and then the tripe camera setup!  I have used Samsung's older models few years back and now with this phone I can see Samsung has come a long way to provide some great value for money phones."
"Have had this phone for over a month now. The best thing about the phone is the battery life. With full charge in morning, there is no need to charge it again throughout d day and another day too if your usage is not about hours of gaming. Fingerprint reader is positioned at d back which is easy and fast. Camera quality is superb. Not really tried all d modes yet, but Auto mode itself is sufficient. Overall a complete value for money phone compared to MI, one plus, etc. Available in the market today"

Other than that nothing in the phone in terms of camera, ram management, sound quality is ok,

I changed the sim to a Motorola and it was viola.. avoid wasting money on this phone or I suggest the whole brand... simply hate this phone, I went to the internet looked for settings, talked to Joi and Airtel customer care.

I had requested to change but they show me the 15 day policy but it was diwali holiday but they don't understand to replace phone and provide me only screen change option. Here device had manufacturing defect but amazon and Samsung both not replaced me my phone. Zero customer approach. From my side say no to amazon and Samsung now. I had seen so many people in service center having similar issues like me. No care for customer one shop near me help ne even after 6 month in my previous phone issue and replace the phone. So go to near by shop."

"This is a very pretty and very chic looking restaurant, and I hoped that the food was as good as the decor.  My friend and I had the sangria and the mojito, and then we shared a bruschetta and the garlic pizza.

I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.

I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.

Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.

We had good service the night we went (a weeknight, around 8:30).  Zero wait for our table, and prompt, polite service.  I would definitely go here again."

Didn't accept from Samsung to launch a value for money phone which can complete with other manufacturers of this segment. The phone is packs all the punch you need for everyday power users with a huge 5000mAh battery.The wide angle camera is way more useful than a second camera for portrait mode. And the display quality is the cherry on the cake.

2. The camera quality is quite decent. Although expected more , but for this price range it is pretty gud.
3.The display is top notch , its quite gud and colorful.
4. The fingerprint scanner has absolutely no time lag. It is very well made.
5. The performance is quite gud. Although, samsung Exynos was used. There was many critics who wished for Snapdragon,  but for daily use it runs well.

The only problem i hv come across is heating. Its not over heating, just little increase in temperature.  This happens only while playing high spec games like PUGB. It is not problem , just mentioned it just in case.

Overall, for people who are looking for a decent gaming and daily use phone. This Samsung Galaxy M31 is my recommendation to you."

My take on Christie's performance at last night's #GOPDebate: he came off as irrelevant &amp; peripheral #Rutgers @NJDACC #Princeton #NJDevils
"Terrible food, terrible service.

I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says, ""chicken fried rice, right?"" I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him that's wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along. So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.

Or at least their version of it.

I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this.

Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and it's not lettuce wraps.

The best thing about my meal was the fountain drink, which cost $1.85. The Circle K in the same plaza has bigger cups for 99 cents."

"No no no...do not go here, now I'm not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy, or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty. It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment. I ordered some tacos and didn't even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat. This place is definitely not a good look"
Yes
It's a very nice phone. Sometimes I wish the fingerprint sensor was a bit more fast. It regularly asks me to wipe the sensor and tau again but then usually works on the immediately next attempt. The battery life is the best part. The phone cam easily last a full day of heavy use with 20-30% battery remaining.  Overall a nice budget phone

"Pros
Amazing display at this price point, 2 day battery backup on moderate to heavy usage,  super light for 5000mah battery phone.

Cons
Average cameras,  poor low light performance,  graphic intensive games dont play smooth,  very slow finger print sensor- takes 2 seconds to detect, akward placement of the sensor placed higher than regular phones.
The most annoying thing however is the spammy ads that pop up everytime.  I tried scanning through various malware/adware detectors but couldn't spot any rogue app.

Bettet Go for redmi note 7 pro  or realme 3 pro unless you are die hard fan of super amoled screen."
I like this product to much because gaming on poco f1 is beast & battery last upto 1 to 2 day* *(usual uses like calls & chating) anyway buy this product I like it

House music is not my thing, watching underage girls snort coke in the bathroom is not my thing, and fighting through people who are under the false impression that they are cooler than me is not my thing.  

They have world-renowned DJs in there every once in a while and a pretty decent chance of celebrity sightings which brings Myst to a whopping 2 stars."

I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech.  I found her on an internet deal.  I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday.  She never returned my call till I reported her.  She denied my 5 messages and said she only got one msg which she couldn't return cause she lost her voice.  She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated.  I would never trust her to do my nails.  Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls.

Product is good but slightly heating issue is there. Although the battery capacity is good but battery time should be better. Camera is good in day light. Front Camera is ok. Fingerprint is working fine. Face unlock is also good. Overall good product at this price but not best.

"Always my favorite coffee shop.

Too bad the baristas remember my fiancé but not me, even though we always come in together. Pfft.

But that's okay. I can take solace in their georgia peach tea and gluten-free/vegan english muffin. Toasted with just the right preserves, it makes my belly happy. I cheated on my diet but that's okay. Just don't tell my doctor.

I have always been a fan of their food. I did knock this down to 4 stars because they seem to have dumped a lot of the vegan/gluten-free options they used to have. Super sad face.

Also, there was a very loud man in there asking for money, yesterday. But he quickly left. Loud conversation is very distracting. It is not the quietest coffee shop if there are many people, but it is still nice!"

This is a good phone for the price but not great . Camera is pathetic which is a great disappointment for me as I chose this for the camera pixel . Touch sensors are good but no premium feel . Battery is great and phone size is optimal to hold it in one hand.

"My g/f love sushi! She made me a connosiuer of it. and I have to be critical. So many college kids ""love"" RA, but it's mediocre at best.

I'll just list a few things that irk me:
I went during a happy hour with co-workers. It was PACKED. Good thing, right? WRONG!
Extremely poor service. when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait. When I said I have a table, she got in my face. I was tired, long-day and I wanted to chill. I walked past her, found my friends, and she left me alone.
The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table, and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW!
I went to Zen 32, and now my choice is SakeBomber. their happy hour servings are much more than RA, and their prices are BETTER!

Be ready for loud noises, as every one is trying to talk louder than the music, and the person next to them.

Just an overall poor experience. and I tip on service. 

Food quality was so-so. Just don't go during a happy hour, which is the only time it's worth it because it's priced so high."

"Okay, I admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party. We tried once before but the hour-plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day. This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible. We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two. 

I had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM! The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked. My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.

Great value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn). If you haven't been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matt's Big is well worth the wait."
Scuzy waiter. Scuzy manager. Overall just a bad experience. The food was pretty awful too. I don't understand how this place is so successful! The food was either waaaay over-seasoned of severely under-seasoned. A hole in the wall Chinese restaurant can produce better Chinese food. And at cheaper prices. Search around. It'll be well worth it.
Horrible service.
Worst phone....waste of money...and now they are not processing return request..
Best phone in price range..camera quality normal not good
Now my phone is totally 30 days and iam not facing any type of problem nice and valuable
"There is a problem with the M30s device.  Camera is of bad quality, it adds artificial colors to skin making it yellowish dull images.  Few minutes of camera usage and battery heats up.  16mp Selfi camera  does not contain zoom in and out feature and most important 48mp camera clicks looks like ordinary, no details.  Eye start paining after few hours of usage.  Even screen of this device is having some defect, pale yellowish even when set to vivid and cool in configuration. One can see the difference in image.

Wish to return this phone or sell it off to some one with 1000/- less then amazon.  I am not satisfied."

"I have just relocated to Scottsdale and eager to find a great wine bar and/or restaurant with a great wine list...and 5th and Wine was the one place that everyone recommended, so I was eager to check it out!

I decided to check it out one night after work, and asked a few co-workers for some delish food choices to try...the bruschetta was the one to try!

I loved the ambiance, very social atmosphere, nice bar scene and small tables, but they also had another room for tables further away from the bar which was more chill and quiet atmosphere.  I was quickly seated at a nice table in the more quiet area, and could scope out the scene. 

I started with a delish glass of Charles LaFitte - Brut France sparking...which for $9 was a deal and refreshing!

I quickly scanned the menu for the bruschetta and my mouth started to water with the selections.  I opted for the prosciutto/fig/marscapone bruschetta and the standard mozzarella/tomato/basil bruschetta!  Both were totally delicious!  The bread was lightly toasted and a bit soft...not like your typical ""crunchy"" bread bruschetta...which I actually enjoyed more than I thought I would.  

I ordered the Beef Bourguignon Julia Childs' ""Beef, Wine, Bacon, Mushroom Stew"" over egg noodles...for $16.96...again, a total deal and totally tasty!  The beef melted in my mouth and the mushroom and sauce was hearty and flavorful!

All in all, the meal was wonderful, and the service was great - very attentive staff - Jonathan, my waiter, was super personable. I also met Scott Yanni, one of the owners, who came over to see how my meal was...and he was very gracious when I told him that I just relocated here and was very happy to find his restaurant as one of my new favorites!

I will definitely be back for more of their great menu and tasty libations!"

but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating,

Auto brightness doesn't work properly.

this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.

Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.

Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.

Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.

Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 30 to 40mins

Low light image quality is very poor.

Don't waste your money buying this phone.

It's so much lovely phone such unic camera and finger print Ai face unlock so much fast speed I like it.... Camera so much like and selfi camera pic so aowsame
Fingerprint reader is very smooth. Camera quality is good. Battery life is exceptional i can go without charging for two days with my usage and also fast charging helps a lot. Good phone in this price range.
"Pro...
1. Display is very good. Awsome.
2. OS is friendly.
3. Performance is as of now good for average usage.
4. A very well try from Samsung, but needs a whole lot of improvement if they want to dominate the mid range segment.

Cons...
1. Camera .... Totally wasted. If u love mobile photography ... Plz dont buy this phone.
2. Heating issue during photography and gaming.
3. GPU is not upto the mark as compared to Adreno series.
4. Build quality... Dose not feel like a mid range premium phone. Chinese makers are far ahead in this or below this price range.
5. Hd fon audio o/p and normal speaker o/p has been compromised.
6. Gaming experience is poor as compared to SD processors within this price range.
7. The battery backup has been over hyped.
8. Some one ... In the name of Samsung India, here in Amazon Q&A section, was claiming the front glass was CG 3, but latter found it is dragon tail glass, nowhere in the competition. Amazon, plz take care of this matter. Don't fool the customers.

Verdict ...
Go for any chinese manufacturers within this price range having SD cheapest...

Best regards"
All features are good
"Battery backup is very low,"
"Poor product not to buy any one
Poor support"
"Selfie camera is not at all good. Samsung has not changed much from its plastic phone image...

Software user interface not good."
Excellent phone..i loved it..only problem I had with OnePlus 7t is it don't have compass sensor..sometimes it doesn't show you exact location..👍
"Below are consolidated , unaudited results for Amanda Capital under IFRS reporting standards ."
"He invokes his questions by his own remarks, however. I don't think reporters should coddle anyone. #GOPDebate  https://t.co/oajsAadEYy"
ok
"It has a very good battery backup. And it's fingerprint sensor can fastly scan the finger and it's face unlock sensor is too good as in face unlock sensor this phone has advanced feature to recognise the fastly.
It's rear and front camera is very good as in front camera there is an inbuilt flash and the live focus and the sticker feature is also good in both cameras but in rear camera there are some more features to capture the memory. And it can come with dot notch display which increase its beauty and has a good processor. And come with good ram and rom at a reasonable price."
Good budget phone
"Simply AWESOME !!!
Always have great experiences with Samsung.
this Samsung M30 exceeds my expectation regarding processing speed, camera, fingerprint sensor etc.
ABOVE ALL amazing battery packup.
MUST BUY phone. Thanks Amazon for good delivery."
"Oxygen OS is a killer. A world of customizations at your fingertips makes you feel totally in control. I have migrated from iPhone 6S and am loving & enjoying the features of this phone and in no way missing the iOS.
At this price offering, I would recommend this phone to all those who want an upgrade but cannot shell out money for an iPhone 11."
Phone battery is not lasting.  Automatically gets drained out even phn is not in use. Also while talking over phone call automatically numbers get dialled gets muted speaker on which is very irritating.Accept camera quality nothing feels like good because other than camera lot of things are there which we need in phone. So for me Bad decision to buy this phone.
camera and battery  is very good
"Poor Quality Phone with huge publicity
Phone is getting heat up.
Phone rear camera quality is very poor.
Speaker is also not good compare to its price.
Phone body is not good.
Charger is very cheap"
"Good mobile its worth for money , battery life amazing and no heating issue.camera quality is superb especially wide angle shot and processor no system issue even if you play big games like pubg etc..."
Camera quality is excellent
Back Camera quality is not good and mobile heating issue after using 4 days I am facing the problem please help me out to return the item.
" Mobile is so light weighted,and thanx to amozon to delivered timely. Camera picture quality very good and i give 10/10 for performance."
"I am facing hanging issue while savingcontacts and placing calls. I have visited two times to service center and Samsung is unable to fix this problem. Every time they just formatting and wasting my time. Samsung is unable to fix software problem. My suggestion to do not purchase Samsung products as no service support.
Not happy at all with this product."
"Samsung m30 is a brilliant smartphone with awesome super amoled display and can take pics with triple rear camera, 5000 mah battery gives you the power all day long and that too with fast charger  provided in the box.
Highly recommended for the normal usage in day to day life,and lastly it's a brand""SAMSUNG"""
"My phone sometimes automatically touches messages from key board unnecessary
Touch screen over keyboard is problem"
Worth for money...it would be much better if battery is given for 5000 mAh
"Phone utna fast nhi jaise ki aur sab h. Camera quality v average h agar dusre phone se tulna ki jay to dhundhla dhundhla pic ata h Samsung camera 48 mp sirf naam ke liye finger print kafi slow h mere redmi note 3 ki tulna me battery achcha h but kafi time lagta h full charge karne me 2:30 se 2:45 ghante lagbhag . Aur sabse bakwas ki inke box na to koi back cover h aur na hi koi screen protection glass . Ye sare review 2 weeks use karne ke bad h maine ise 12599 me liya tha ,
2 weeks me hi isme halke halke scratches aa gaye h.
Isse acha realme note 5pro h jiska camera isse bahut achcha h.
Isme sirf naam ke liye 48mp h"
"Phone is getting hanging, no external memory, no battery backup, Charging problem, not received cash back till now.
very very bad phone,,, i'm facing lot of problems."
This is a status update to twitter from ICE  Timestamp: Sun May 10 10:57:44 CEST 2009
" awww, that sucks  But they`re so awesome when you get one, all squeeky and happy. I only have one left now though"
Overall the phone is awesome ..as always Amazon products are  the best 😊
Camera & battey quality is good but there is a problem in touch.
There is no ear phone in the vivo box only phone and charger is there. There is no ear phone lead in the vivo box.
I wanna longboard but it`s raining ughhhhhh
what happened to your phone
"Speed of mobile is Good, no hanging, smooth gaming. For me Camera not up to the mark...as I earlier used Samsung note5 and 8mp of note5 is much better then this 64mp. Samoled is great. Finishing of the product is so not good....alignment of fitting lacks perfection. Camera holes alignment or side edge you can see poor craftsmanship."
"The touch is not working properly while gaming and the notch is hiding some features while rotating the screen
Touch is miserable while gaming"
"Pros:
Battery life.
Amoled Display quality and size.
wide angle camera lens.
build quality.
fast fingerprint sensor.
RAM and Internal memory.

Cons:
heats a little bit while charging and playing graphics heavy games.
processor not that best in class for this price.
lowlight camera and overall camera quality for this price could be better."

"IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!
My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).
This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. 

We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. 

We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. 
To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family."
Food was good. Slow service. First time that I've had to walk outside through a parking lot to get to the bathroom.
"The phone blows you away with it's speed. Upgraded from OnePlus X and continue to be a fan of OxygenOS and OnePlus. Phone's UI is buttery-smooth and the experience is just unbelievable. At this price, the phone is truly a flagship-killer or rather a flagship phone in itself.

No hesitation in recommending this phone. 10/10!!"
"This dry-rub barbecue was delicious. The ""sassy"" barbecue sauce was meh, but the sweet was good enough to make up for it."
"Excellent display, snappy fingerprint scanner
Fluid SD855+ performance
Warp charge is ridiculously fast
Oxygen OS remains the biggest highlight as always.
Rear design controversial, but full marks for the innovation
Price puts it ahead of the rest in the business, and could well backfire OnePlus themselves, coz honestly it's a way better deal than the 7 pro or the 7t pro, which is seriously overpriced for my liking...."
Amazing
Cammera quality is average. Indoor shots not up to mark.
"Some People talking abt heating issue with this device but seems have taken money to degrade MI Note 8 Pro because nothing like that, Super Premium phone with inbuilt Alexa and IR Blasters but No One has included these features in their unboxing again personal benefits may be...Camera Quality is Awesome Awesome"
Value for money good build quality and good processer and good battery life and good charging speed and quality control for money
"LOVE it and so close to home!  Since Pita Jungle open in Glendale I have been at least once a week (Yes, really!)  The hummus and garlic dip are to die for and on my last trip I tried a Greek Pita-Oh my!  The fruit on the Caribbean salad and the fruit and cheese plate are amazing and the chicken combo plate is so large it's two meals!

The ambiance is slightly different than the other locations but I think that is mostly due to the fact that two sides of the restaurant are glass.  Pita Jungle Glendale still features a revolving collection of art work and you can see the funky style of the other locations in the hand painted chairs and the cool artwork painted in the bathrooms.  The staff is also  extremely friendly."
"Really happy with this phone. The camera quality is very good, triple lens for wide angle shot serves good purpose. Having 4gb ram enables very good gaming experience considering the brilliant display too. For me battery life is something very tempting about this phone, a huge 5000maH provides me 2 day continuous usage, fast charge helps too. The phone is very sleek and light. Audio quality is pretty good as expected from Dolby, and is loud. The phone has a classy look and the gradient colour at the back adds to it. Overall it's the best phone to buy at this price. Very satisfied."
"camera fine, but battery chagring is continued  after getting 100% not shown full battery or no stopcocks .."
"Never ever buy Samsung phones.. many of my friends suggested not to buy this phone, but didn't listen to them.. now I am suffering.. extremely slow.. sometimes touch do not work and many other issues.."
Mobile phone performance is good but really disappointed with camera specially front facing very poor quality. Overall avagre rating is 4/5 but for camera 1/5
"This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. It's a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are:

Island Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that it's seasonal makes it even more of a special treat.

Camarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains.

Maduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more?

Mojito... best in town in terms of authenticity.

Marquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table.

Other worthy options: 
Arroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really don't like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didn't even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical!

Fritoras de Frijoles Negros... I've never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole!

Calypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains.

Sun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable!

Datiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best I've had but pretty darn good.

Empanaditas... These are alright... though I'm partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving.

Tamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale.

Flan... haven't had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent.

Free Goodness: Their Bread! It's just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle!

As you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... I'm quite content to dine with others and share Havana's wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one. Can't wait to try it... with a side of Camarones al Ajillo and a Mojito!"
"Superb battry backup, lasts for full 2 days with heavy calling and internate usage.

Good with all feature
"When I get the urge to eat out, I'm normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where I can sit back, chat, and enjoy my meal.  With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu (Chicken & Waffles, and S'mores for dessert), I definitely enjoyed this place.  My first time here was for a Yelp event so I was able to try just about everything.  My favorites would have to be the mac & cheese and the beef brisket--both delicious!  I'd say they've got their BBQ technique mastered, at least where the brisket is concerned.  And the cornbread is probably the best I've had--so happy they handed out the recipe at the event.  The service was great; everyone was friendly and very helpful.  I was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come back--and probably leave with tasty leftovers!"
Not worth for Money
Good product
morning! just got my coffee

"This is the new mecca of Phoenix music. 

Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman. 

The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!

Thank you Charlie!

Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!

btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment)."
"After proLonged usage i write this review,

3. Battery life is ok.

Descent display and matrrial quality"

Very nice
"I went here with a party of 6 on Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting when we got there which was nice.  It is an older place with tons of charm.  The place was pretty busy and you could tell that the waiters/servers/busers were clearly over worked.

After sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order.  After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills.

The service was pretty blah but the food was excellent.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Everything was freshly made and delicious  Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around.  Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.

I would definitely return but hope the service is better."
Amazing + awesome + just wow
Snappier phone I've ever used . Gorgeous display and a great build .
Iï¿½m really desappointed...

"We tried this place after reading most of the reviews.  I had rice noodle soup w/ fishballs, squid, shrimp & veggies and hubby had shredded pork sandwich.   Both were good and plenty of food.  The pork sandwich was so cheap, it was hard to believe it wasn't a typo.  Beats a Subway anyday!  The neighborhood is a bit shady but if you don't mind that, it is fine.  Service was quick and we will definitely revisit this place.  People kept pouring in during the dinner hours.  Can't beat the price!"
The phone is good. But camera quality is very poor. Please oppo sovle ta camera quality by giving us software updates. Price is slightly overpriced. battery of the phone is really noticable. But again camera is not good as described.

Excellent phone by Xiaomi and for the current price its more than value for money!
Undoubtedly the best buy under 20k if you are ok with older design especially the big notch, rear fingerprint sensor and a plain back (unless you buy the armoured edition)!"

Got it for34.5k and was a great deal for me.

The fluidity of the OS is the main thing.
Besides going for other brands go for it."
1 month baad hi apne aap display kharab ho gya . Low quality of materials

Camera quality is good but not justify the 64mp performance. It's looks like just tag, not more then that.
Performance is OK OK.
Too much Ads."
Got great camera but my need was battery life so I got this phone for long battery life and quick charging it have great battery life and also charge very fast  you should think to buy this if it's in your budget
"I have been coming here since discovering them after their opening week last year and I haven't stopped coming back. The food is predominantly Filipino; the Filipino-Mexican fusion comes in the burritos, flautas and quesadillas filled with Filipino meat dishes. A great starter would be the Chicken Adobo burrito. Karey's does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito; they're served on the side. 

For those more interested in rice plates and combinations, Karey's serves daily prepared dishes such as Pork Adobo and Chicken Adobo (pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette) and Beef Mechado (a type of stew with beef chunks, potatoes, and onions in a light tomato gravy) with either white rice or Garlic Fried Rice (yummy). There are also specials that rotate each day, which can be checked out on their Twitter account. This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon (roasted pig)! Yum!

There are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials.  The ones I've tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia (fried eggrolls in chicken, beef, or vegetable) and Pancit Canton (stir-fried noodles with vegetables). The pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it, and I preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve now...but it's still good ;)

Not only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to. Karen and Rey make you feel truly at home. The best thing about Karey's Kitchen is having a Filipino restaurant in Phoenix and not having to drive all the way to the East or West Valley!"
Awesome
Great performance in all gaming and camera is great
I was using 1plus 3T from last 2.5 years and I was satisfied with it. I was happy that I am upgrading my phone with 1plus 7pro which I have heard about a lot but my expectations were shattered when I used its camera. The camera quality is very poor as compared to what has been shown in the launch event. I am very disappointed with it as my main purpose to buy this phone is because of its camera. It's battery life is also just OK as I have to charge it on frequently basis
Only disappointment is the battery life.  Could have been better.
Just kidding! Don`t go around quoting me
It is working smoothly at all aspects. Important thing is battery backup which is very good.  Nice camera and smooth function of finger print reader. Nice display which is great for watch movies. Good value for money
The product has a great battery performance and well balanced RAM management keeps in memory all my useful apps. Although the Fingerprint sensor doesn't work sometimes. Automatically the touch screen works. Flashlight turns on automatically. Single press on power button makes turns on the shut down mode.
It is the worst product. I am only using it from 20 days and it screen is blacking out. After sales service is pathetic of both Xiomi and worst from Amazon. Both have denied to replace the product.
"awesome go for it
i got it 8999 Rs"
The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters.  My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had.  I will never go back to that theater again.  I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab.
Display is very nice

"Good looks.  But Samsung has not provided with screen guard and back cover, which other companies do provide at same price range.
C charger is good and quick.
A software update is required as many apps stops all of a sudden and restart automatically .
Samsung should have offered 64GB phone at price tag of 10000/-"
"This is the best mid range mobile phone.
The picture editing quality is superb..
One problem is that This phone is bulky or heavy.."
"I have used bfr this mobile Poco F1
Note 8 pro
Pros:
Camera seriously impressed in gud light
HelioG90 😎
Cons :
Alexa not much great
Little heat continuous playing not much .
Over all its Worth"
Model was good but compared to other products phones camera quality is not good in this mdoel and battery life ok
Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!
Too much hanging problem in the handset plz avoid to buy it
"This phone is all about the hype.. Using from 2 weeks, hung up several times, screen got frozen once, finger unlock is not that great. Face unlock is super fast, camera and video quality is good. Google Play is not updating some apps, don't know why. Charges fast.. good screen."
"Here is the genuine review....don't expect too much from this product it is as like other products ... normal battery, good handy device, performance not so high not so low ..overall it's a budget device to buy."
That is amazing she will be happy with it enjoy your sunday  ****
"Please read my review carefully. First two lines following this line were my review feedback after using the product for couple of days and the rest are added today (4th Sep 2019).

Much waited product. Camera awesome  battery lasts for 3 days for normal use. Superb display. Watched Amazon prime videos in full screen mode and simply it rocks. Fluidic performance.

My Review after using the product for more than 5 months:

Guys, I picked this phone after a thorough research and the tough competitor was Redmi Note 7 Pro. But Samsung won due to the careless fabrication, finishing and assembling of Redmi Phones. You will be first hijacked with lot of positive reviews. But remember, never ignore even one negative feedback. So, I was not bowled out by the higher resolution camera offered by other brand but chosen the quality over other stuff.  Let me come to the points.

PROS:

BUILD QUALITY: Never experienced any hanging or heating issues. Awesome Fluidic SAMOLED display.
CAMERA: Great photos are so easy to snap. Look at my samples. I am not a professional photographer and I am totally convinced with what M30 can do for me.
BATTERY: Whenever I take my car for long rides with 450+ KM distance for 7+ hours M30 always stayed with enough power to use GPS. It was the feat I was always wanted in a phone.
PERFORMANCE: 4GB RAM is enough for me to install all my needed apps and the phone is flawless. Apart from the built-in 64 GB RAM, I have added 128 GB SD Card. I will never delete a single file for couple of years.
SOUND: The voice quality, speaker volume and DOLBY ATMOS support are really great. We won't get this from cheap mid-range competitor phones or even from the closely competing phones.
MAINTENANCE: Samsung provided the OS upgrade to Android 9 with One UI 1.1. Security patches are released frequently.

CONS:
Though I am convinced with the camera output, I want Samsung to provide better camera with improved low light and dark scene support.

Overall it is a great phone."
Battery & display is good... other than that there is nothing with this phone ... Both rear & front camera very pathetic ... & some times network issue ... and it takes 2 better go for m30
"I recently visited Olive and Ivy for business last week, and after 3 visits, I am convinced that Fox Restaurants has some of the best establishments in the valley.  Olive and Ivy is the Fox Restaurant of choice for consistently good food, great drinks, and most of all, outstanding service.  I spend a lot of time in various restaurants across the valley and am always amazed at how bad service can be at some of the more popular valley restaurants.  Not Olive and Ivy.  From the first phone call for reservations, to the greeting upon walking in the door to the smiles and warm reception you receive from every server you cross, this restaurant knows how to make you feel special.

Many of the reviews here will focus on the food and I could spend hours talking about my experiences but I will sum it up in a couple of my favorites. 

I hate dates and prunes, but the bacon wrapped dates are crazy good!
The shrimp and risotto main course is one of the best dishes I have tasted since arriving in Phoenix 3 years ago.  And hands down, their short rib entree is best in the valley.

The only catch is the cost.  Olive and Ivy is not cheap and definitely not for brothers looking to execute the cheap date.  With wine, apps, and main course, you will easy break the century mark, and if you are really being generous, $200 is obtainable.  But, it's worth every dollar and who knows, you may even get breakfast out of the deal!"
Awesome phone. It's display is not much good. And brightness of phone also not as much as other phones have.
"So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky. 

Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!"
Mobile phone is the best
"Phone is very good looking,battery life and network connection is also very good."
Camera quality is avrage very disappointed
It`s ok now ! I`ve cleared my cache and everything is fine
great for budget mobile
"I received the product in good condition...thanks Amazon.in for fast delivery....

6GB RAM _128GB ROM...
Valued for money of Rs 12998/-
I would recommend Amazon.in for any kind of shopping..."
"Phone is good but flashlight is not working on video calling. Went to service centre but they told its comman issue with redmi. When any update will come, we will notify you. Think about it before purchase."
Battery not good.
Battery
Very display quality 1 fit down sell then broken display please don't purchase this phone very poor quality
Great phohe at this price. Specially battery performance is awesome
"I am using this phone from 5-6 months and realize that over all phone is good , but battry performance very bad ,however battry is 5000 mah and camera is average , also draw back is my memory card not supported......"
Everything worth the value of the phone
Sweet! I`m a Jaycee one-letter-er I think. Just D!
Very bad product provided by amazon after using 10 days getting the screen problem .One vertical black line on screen
Phone is good but battery backup is usual / very less. Performance and Sound quality is excellent. It heats up after playing a game for an hour and consumes very much battery during that time. More features were expected in Android one but has usual features like previous OS.
"This is the first Springhill Suites that I've stayed at.  Service was good.  Hotel was clean.  Room was acceptable.  Big enough to work in, nothing special.   Fitness Room was small but that was fine as I was the only one using it.  The breakfast on par for what you would receive when you stay at a hotel.  They could use better coffee.

Very nice hotel to stay at if you have business at the convention center."
Camera quality best
Mic and speaker problem
"So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM!

This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts.

The Chefs Pizza of the day hasn't let me down yet... We don't even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour. 

Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case. 

The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says ""Complimentary"" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want."
"It had been 3 months since I've purchased the product. So far it has been a great experience, overall, using the product. The only thing is that it gets hot sometimes when you use it continuously for a long time and even its use while in charging makes it hot. But I don't think its much of a concern."
"The mobile is phone is quite handy as compared to other phones. In this range , Samsung M20 is really nice but if you can invest 2k -3K more you will get Samsung M40 which has good camera features.  The battery life is good and works really fine.  I really liked the phone."
"Mmmmmmm. I love Espresso......the app, that is. I guess the real thing helps me work efficiently too"
"Featuring the S60 user interface , this 135-gram model also comes with a 2.4-inch quarter VGA display and 100 megabytes of internal memory , expandable through the Micro Secure Digital slot ."
Good
"You have to know what you're looking for to find this place.  I've passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it.

We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.

Overall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time, I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.

Return Factor - 80%"
Worst camera. Phone becomes very slow sometimes. Installation on Playstore becomes too slow sometimes.
right..  making compromises is what kills us!
"Eyes close take redmi note 8 . Budget phone ,nice camera 48 and battery backup is good"
Don't  bye anyone battery backup and touching problems more.
"The overall quality of the phone is good. But the front screen, they say it is Gorilla glass but I've been using this phone for one month and it has got a lot of tiny tiny scratches. So make sure to use a screen protector."
It's very good phone in just 9000 thousand... Battery watch very good looks beautiful isl better performance camera watch awesome also beautiful look all feature are available in this phone. I am so happy to bought this phone. Thanks vivo team for making vivo U10
Product is okay as per price but camera quality should be more effective.
Bad

"It is very bad charging time saying fast charging but it is taking too late to full battery..
It is 5000mah batter but Quickly decreasing charging..."
It's not been one month. I purchased it on 19th February.  Yesterday while getting the mobile charged it show that moisture has been detected in your charger/USB port. What the hell! It's so sophisticated then why Samsung even made it. It's gets hang very often. Worst product ever purchased from Amazon.
This phone is horrible..it's been about 2 months and IV had so much trouble ..the battery is bad...the software acts funny at times ..apps close on its own ..the keyboard starts typing on its own ...please don't buy this ..

Camera:
Not recommend for camera user because redmi note 7 pro and realme 3pro is very very better when compared with price"
Samsung was always first choice but now these m series make them again leader they again providing best of their version great one phone.
"Phone screen becomes black during call and it doesn't turn on back and you can't even cut the call. Except Camera nothing is great. No separate headphone jack, C type connector reqd for headphones and u can either charge ur phone or use headphones, both are not possible together. No slot for micro SD card, feels I should have checked all these things before buying."
It is almost a month....fingers print is not good....touch is also bed. After update little bit improved but not good at all.
Nice
I like 90z refresh rate
"Battery life- is very good u can essays use it for 8 to 9 hour nearly
Fingerprint is also very good
Front camera is excellent
The processer work very well
The phone is also curve from side
And meanly it's very easy to handle"
"I still really like the Studio Movie Grill, but sat in the ""General Admission"" seats last night for the first time, and found that they were not nearly as comfortable as the ""Reserved"" seats with their own little tables.  Unfortunately.

The GA seats are also quite tightly shoved together, so if it is a full house you are bumping up against your neighbor, and it is distracting.

Best bet:  Go to a un-crowded movie and sit in one of the reserved seats that is not pre-reserved (not pre-sold, and doesn't have the little ""reserved"" sign on it) to enjoy the reserved seats at the GA price."
"Worst phone
-Slowest fingerprint sensor, most of the time doesn't even work
-Heating issue even with normal usage. During gaming it gets heated very much
-Processor also slow, cheaper vivo phones are faster than this
-Camera is just OK
-Battery takes 3 hr to charge

Everything is just OK or below average about the phone, nothing is great, just avoid Samsung phones"
Battery is 6000mah but not run more than 1 day and camera quality is also not good and charging is too slow so overall disappointed by samsung
Except fingerprint reader everything is upto the mark. Specially speaking about the camera and battery capacity.
It's showing battery life.. Battery is getting drain within 8 hrs with very low use...
Getting into the swing of things. I miss someone
Not bad not good
haha. thanks for listening to me rant on and on about nothing!  have a good NIGHT?
Nice phone in budget not for heavy gaming

I am with this product.camera quality could be a better and battery good but not great.gaming experience is awsm.
Micro camera
Phone with 4 gb ram and 64 gb internal storage is running slower than a 2gb ram and 8gb storage phone. Perfectly done samsung. Product looks good but can barely complete the functions of calling and typing without significant lag.

"Everything is perfect whether

"Excellent neighborhood spot with outstanding food, large portions and reasonable price. The staff make you feel special and I have not made a bad menu choice. Try the wings with sauce on the side or the Monday night fried chicken. Lunch or dinner, Wallys receives 5 stars from me."
"are you joking? Where else can you get the best salami, ham, any cold cuts anywhere? I just moved here 6 months ago and have been searching for a place like this. Their meats are fantastic. I discovered this place after driving by it so many times. thought I'd take a chance. Location is awful. but worth the trip."
Good product with this price range
Baste fone
 Very nice product in low price
worth for money till now
"Liked the Display and the Speaker of this product. The inhand feeling is awesome and the triple camera setup on the rear adds a star into that premium  look. Fingerprint sensor is a bit of upset maybe resolved with some updates. And the camera is good, except  the portrait mode is sometimes  a bit upsetting. Battery is great lasts 2 days.
All over on a scale of 10, 8 from my side. And Samsung is Samsung.
*Updated Review after 3 months of usage*:-
Received an OS update to Android 10,
but after update performance is not the same. Battery is draining faster now and sometimes phone Ganges like old Samsung galaxies. Want Samsung to resolve the problem with an OTA update ASAP."

"I like battery life most, and fast charger in box is great.
Also Camera does good work.
Nice looking phone, but fingerprint reader not as fast."
Superb
Mobil pay bil is not a mobil box
"The phone is best in its class and for the price it is available, i would say there is nothing wrong.
The battery once fully charged can go for whole 24 hours against normal use which includes 2-3 hours of gaming(hope my manager is not reading this), insta surfing, watching netflix for another 2 and 3-4 hours of calling.
Camera no doubt is best in its class. I know there are better ones in the market but they are also priced accordingly.
All that and add samsung's one UI to it. You get a perfect phone."
Worst Phone I ever use . Don’t buy . Go for Other brands in this price Range.
"Samsung M20 phone in excellent with the price of 13000. I have personally  used it from 25th of March and it's performance is to good as compare to other same range mobile phones.

I have suggested many peoples as well to buy the Mseries mobile phone are awesome.

Samsung is a good company.

No doubt phone is awesome but camera quality and fingerprint needs to be improved more as expected by Samsung hopefully in new segment."
"Battery back is poor, Camera quality is not good as 48 mp , Overall product is average"
"Camera good
Display not good"
Nic mobile.every features are good.
The camera quality and apps running speed is so fast. Also its battery backup is superb. 6 gb ram gives amazing experience for gaming speed.overall its price worth mobile in budget.
lil heavy and reduced camera quality than other sets of oppo but overall good
"Cons:-Picture quality  is very poor.very difficult to blur background.doesnot blur subjects without face. Night shot quality  is horrible.No slowmotion,time lapse.realme U1 is much more better than so called  Samsung m20.now want to return  but can't.Totally waste my 11k."

"I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same.

The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning."

Very bad gaming experience even in smooth extreme . The game started to lag after 1 week even in 60 ping . After connecting hotspot  from your device its useless to play pubg in any setting.  the display  dont respond some times . i m just praying for my phone replacement or return .
The box was in a damaged condition but no problem with the phone and no missing items over all phone is ok with its price. Mainly disappointed by the handling of the package by the agents.
Its an awesome phone with good camera. People who love Android phones and have a budget of 40 K this is the best option. Nice design and everything is good

Battery life is better than other Samsung phones.

Battery life and charging rate is very good but mobile changed many times in a day and screen up and down like picture vibrate. I didn't used finger print so I can't give any comment about them. Overall not up to expectations.

"Bleh! 

I've heard good things about this place from my sister's friends (notice, I didn't say ""my"" friends) and I've always been curious.  Errand days are kinda ho-hum anyway, so I was excited to finally check this place out.  The reason I order a doughnut that is stripped off glaze and topping is that I'd  like to taste the actual product. 

Two doughnuts for my little guy and me for $1.60.  As the girl handed me the paper bag I was extra careful handling it for nothing.  Cold doughnuts?  Am I just so used to piping hot beignets?    Right off the first bite, I could feel the cheap hydrogenated oils coating the roof of my mouth.  Then the second bite, the feeling is now in my throat.  Eeek!  I asked my son what he thought.  ""It's okay,""  he stared at the doughnut and looked up at me.  I grab his doughnut and along with mine threw both in the paper bag it came with and chucked it.   Honestly, it would have been better to fry these sinful things in lard.  There is something about chemically laden food that I despise most!

Would I give it a second chance?  Not until they change their frying oil!

Sorry, Bosa.  One star is for the nice service and the other star is for being a local chain."

"The three of us ate at Famous Dave's last evening and had a really nice time! 

We stopped in around 5:30 or so and were seated at a booth in the bar area. It was still early, so there was plenty of seating throughout the restaurant. Our server came by a few moments after we were seated and asked about our drink order. Nice. 

If you have never been to a Famous Dave's, it's sort of like a Texas Roadhouse, which is a complement. I've had some really good BBQ over the years in local Roadhouses throughout the US, and clearly this chain has copied the model. 

We started with some onion strings and chicken tenders off the Happy Hour menu along with our drinks. Both were good, but ordinary. What made them good was Dave's sauce. At each table you have five or six choices, as well as the sauce that came from the kitchen. 

For dinner we order a Pulled-Pork sandwich with sides, a large BBQ Huli platter and some Texas steak tips grande nachos. Each was delicious and large enough that we couldn't finish. One observation on portions, they are large -- like two Styrofoam take home boxes large 

For dessert we order some $1.98 mini puddings and brownies. Just the right size for everyone after a large dinner. 

Fellow Yelper Scott D put it best in his 7/23/10 review: ""Famous Dave's consistently delivers no matter which location you go to"". Our party of three heartily agrees! 

The tab came to $69.49, including taxes but without tip. We thought that was fair given the serving size and the tastiness of the food. We will be back! 

Enjoy!"

"Those who are rating the phone with five star, i dont know wheather they buy it or not..in one sentence after using it i can say about the phone that dont buy it..pls if you want to waste your money, lot of options are there but purchasing this product will be waste of waste.."
The phone is one of the best phone with very good battery backup. The camera quality is not very good  compared to similar ranged phones. Finger print reader is also not so fast in the section. Display quality is good.
"After 2 months of use, the phone started restarting during charging. The issue started when I received a call while charging. The phone hung and ringing continued till the service center person switched off the phone by using  hard stop. I was managed to charge the phone  using USB and its went well for somedays. After 2 3 days the restart issue started for USB  charging as well."

"You'll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.  The decor hasn't been updated in at least 20 years.  Looks like it's falling apart.  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well, although there are a couple flat screens as well.  This is where the trash hangs out, of all colors.  The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldn't find them.  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.  Service was interesting.  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.  The price wasn't bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza, wings and 2 sodas.  I'd rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street."
"Lots of network related issues. It switch 4g to 3g in every single seconds. Battery drain very fast.

" It`s been fine for me for like, a week, but now it just won`t load."
"I have been a ""regular"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... 

The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The ""massage"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back."

"Sandwiches are pretty decent and tasty..however..

they don't include drinks, salad, just a small cookie on the side. We just ordered 2 sanwiches and 2 sodas, a little on the overpriced side, totaled out to $27 just for that. The sandwiches are gigantic or anything. just left feeling a bit hungry and disappointed."
"My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though."
Battery is not so good. Since this mobile has 6000 mah i was expecting better battery life but its draining very fast. I felt like it's just 4000mah. And camera as not good as its 48MP. Sometime I may not able to receive call . Please refer attached screenshot
"Went here for a saturday lunch with a girlfriend. The building is amazing and beautiful, very clean. I'm not generally a ""Scottsdale crowd"" type of gal, but the place was nice, and the music was good too. The menu looked so delicious that we had a hard time deciding what to get. Our waiter was very kind, didn't try to rush us, and gave us plenty of time to decide. 

We had a house salad, dirty chips, and an order of sliders. The house salad seemed a bit over priced for what it was, but the dirty chips were really good! The sliders were average, and well priced.

I really want to go back and try a happy hour sometime to try more of the small plates, our only regret was that the order of dirty chips was BIG, we could only finish half of it. A half sized portion would have been perfect, though!"
nice it is
It comes in Very good condition. The battery life is almost 36 h with normal use.

"Fingerprint  is too smooth,camera quality is awesome & battery is too long period"
"When you're on a budget and looking for an affordable premium looking phone with a smooth UI.
Get this Redmi Note 8.

But I will list some Cons that I faced with the phone:-
1) Face Unlock isn't that much fast as It should have been.
2) Camera Bump.
3) Front Camera is average.

P.S. - Otherwise Everything about this phone is great be it's look, design, processor, battery, charging time etc.
Lastly, Thanks to MI & Amazon for this GREAT phone. Go for it without any DOUBTS...."

"Battery backup wrost . Compare any other item redmi is very low cost, now I came to know y they are selling low cost. They mentioned 6gb ROM performance look like 1gB ROM, before redmi note 8 I purchased redmi note 3 with 3gb ROM ,compare to this mobile performance wise wrost condition . Photos also not up to the mark and body weight also heay.  Finally my suggestion is "" Dabbulu oorike ravu "". This peace from last one month am using now I want to sell . Still any one interest to buy contact me."
Awesome product :)
this product  is really awesome..it is perfect for photography ..for long journey as the battery backup is great..for gaming purpose..everything works perfect..a worth buying product
A complete premium smartphone with all features!! Camera quality is amazing. performance is outstanding.
Go for it
"Good, fresh chinese food, a little pricey.

There are two types of chinese food. Cheap, greasy, satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint. And upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like P.F Chengs. This would be the latter: an awhatukee hole in the wall version of P.F chengs. Very clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, and good service. You can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand :/. This is the kind of place you'll find a lot of older families, or much older groups of friends dining together in. 

Both the orange chicken, and the almond chicken were good, and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8), with big fresh peices of white meat, fresh vegetables, and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease, textures, or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).

Both dishes were good, but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes I tried. 

The green tea ice cream was good, but I've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream, and could have used some fruit, or something creative to go with the ice cream. 

The only other dessert option was another flavor of ice cream.

The service was great, very polite and friendly waiters."

Everything in this phone is good if you look at the price tag
Pubg runs smoothly, camera a excellent, display is so good

This doesn't mean that the device looks cheap, device looks pretty good but I accidentally dropped it from my study chair and it got a crack in screen which cost me 4500 I mean a chairs isn't that high that it can cause such damage of course it is the bad built quality but it is a good device if yoh look at price and specifications"

"Though I am a big fan of Redmi Note series phones and have been using since Note 2 4G time. But this time it disappointed me a lot because of very poor audio quality and the issue with the grip of the phone. Camera quality could have been better although its a 64 mega pixel but quality id very bad. I think Xioami needs to rethink on their strategy of quickly producing various models just to be in the market. Rather they should focus on stability in the market by providing quality product by taking good time to design, develop and market.

I am not liking at all writing such feedback for Redmi phone but quite disappointed this time."
And I`m listening to 'Wrong' by Depeche Mode.
"I just wanted to mention cons abt the phone which I experienced. MI forgot to include these minor but most important applications. Like
-Voice recorder
-Inbuilt doc scanner
-Many more to miss when explored
No separate audio jack (WHERE I CAN'T USE THE HEADPHONES IF MOBILE CHARGE IS LOW, BIGGEST FLAW)
MI oly concentrated on increasing camera features n display, and forgot to include fingerprint option to take pictures.

I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED BUYING THIS PHONE, WHERE I CAN GO for low configuration mobiles with less prices."
i am a bit more curious: how much did you pay for it?
Phones good and displays awesome
Battery life is good
Fingerprint reader was damaged and i have requested for new one
All features are fantastic and performing well

"Camera quality is pretty average for both front and back. Don't take real life pic's , colour reproduction is average. Even my samsung galaxy m 30 take better pictures. So it's simply a mid range gaming phone. So don't buy it for camera, which is redmi's marketing gimmick."
Screen touch and fingerprint scanner not good. I requested for replacement but When I asked for replacement customer care no not contactable. Waiting for Amazon support call to solve my problem.
Samsung galaxy M31 is the best option from Samsung in this price range.
"Excellent battery life, speed and clarit.

"Lo Lo's is pretty much what you'd expect a place focusing on ""Chicken & Waffles"" to be. Small, lively, full of smiling people all eating, well......chicken and waffles. The line out front attests to its popularity. 

After finishing the Phoenix 10K this morning, our group decided that Lo Lo's would be the perfect place to undo all of the health gains we had made. Little did I know that I would be undoing an entire year's worth of morning jogs. It was the sort of experience that makes you wonder if you should consult a cardiologist. 

We had a short wait for our table, but were able to quench our thirst on soft drinks, punch, and sweet tea. The staff was extremely friendly. Everyone who works here seems to love it. 

I am a big fan of chicken. I am a big fan of waffles. Yet, I have never had them together. Thus, I decided the only choice for me was their No. 1 Meal, called KK's. Three (3!) pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs w/ cheese and onions. I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Lo's, I was going to go for it. 

The food came pretty quickly. The first thing that struck me were the two enormous globs of butter (1 in my grits and 1 on my waffles). In all my life, I have never knowingly eaten this much butter in a single sitting. That being said, it was divine. Everything was delicious and, while I am not a big ""fried chicken"" guy, I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly. Other members of our group sampled the fried okra and the red beans & rice. I heard nothing but happy sounds as our table of 7 made approximately 15,000 calories disappear. This was followed by groans and calls for afternoon naps as we all piled into our cars to go home. 

Lo Lo's is one of those experiences that should not be missed. But, make sure to clear your afternoon and, just to be safe, you may want to consult a health professional."

Good but price is very hair
No competition with one plus
Samsung has played a masterstroke by this phone .I got this phone just for rs 10k and believe me it justify it's worth. The main thing of this phone is it's massive battery it last for 2 days if you are a normal user and even if you are a heavy user it will last for a day nd it has fast charging too. The only problem I face in this phone is it's front camera . Front camera is not at par level. On the other hand rear camera is decent with the secondary camera with the wide angle . This phone has all the basic sansors over all its a good phone in this price segment .
Very nice mobile picture clarity super
Very very bad phone against others
Best ever phone. 90 hz display is just awesome and camera is great.
"Samsung M 30 is really a good product under Rs 20000/-. Any comman can buy this within his/her budget. All the phones have merits and demerits whether you are picking a budget or high range phone.
Yes it's processor which is not so good as compare to M40. But overall  it's a nice one having 6gb n 128gb."
Yeah. It totally sucks.  I hate not being able to breathe! Thanks for the ff!

"All functions work well except fingerprint reader .

Slow response for all apps opening. Camera quality not good.  To store camera images to Internal/External storage it's taking more time. Not recommended to buy this product.
"Not much impressed at this price range. No headphone jack provided, Not much improvement. Processor is good but weight balance is not perfectly done. Phone is heavy to handle. Selfie camera is not a great one."
"Fast access biometric, xllent picture quality and long 5k battery for my long  long calling usage for which I am a proud owner of this M 20 Korean mobile"
this is the 1st time I bought a not so reliable phone brands i have always been using a samsung or a nokia phone. And this miA3 has totally proved me right about my apprehension. worst camera quality. pictures are extremely pixeleted. they blur out even in normal mode. very very bad camera quality. worst UI. while receiving calls it gives me random errors. while on a call randomly mute or loudspeaker or any other buttons get activated. super orritating phone it is. only good thing is a super battery life. so its nothing more than 2k worth phone fr its battery life.
"Disadvantages
- Do not support clone app other than few social apps.
- get hung sometimes, not that fast
- Wifi range is less, it's not connecting at the place where my old 12k mobile connecting to wifi.
- doesn't take photos with finger print sensor.
- Auto bright sensor works doesn't work properly sometimes
- Photo quality is not good with back regular cam
- I personally do not like OS.

Advantages
- good battery life
- wide angle takes takes really good pics
- selfie cam is good
- Slow motion and hyperlaps but hyperlaps takes more time to generate small video."
"Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....

Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.

Pros:
Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.

As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.

Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.

In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.

The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.

I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.

Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.

The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.

Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.

Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.

Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.

The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.

The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.

The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.

Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.

Cons:
Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.

There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.

The Camera software is not optimized yet.

Battery life can be an issue for some users.

The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation."
Not good
Worst in camera clarity. Waste of money. Kindly don't recommend to anyone.
Super display like premium 15k phones. In hand giving attractive look.
"This phone was asome and the phone update was not at good but it was nice
I think you all must try"
"#Amazing battery life
#Extraordinary camera"
"One stars for me right now..  As there is a manufacturing defect on my MI a3. There is a dust present inside the camera on back. I already registered an exchange complain. Now let's see how the things shape up.
Will give my full review when I will receive my new product."
"Only 3 finger prints can be added.
Coming from pure android, I miss google now the most.
Lots of unwanted samsung apps.
Great battery life.
Rear Camera is near the edge and you have to hold it very carefully to not cover it with a finger while clicking landscape shots."
Fingerprint reader is literally quite slow. In display fingerprints are usually slow and serve no other purpose. Where as physical fingerprint serve as slider to navigate web pages and other contents. Battery life is awesome just bcoz of 720 p display and amoled screen. 720 p display doesn't bother of you're just a light user. You'll notice minor flaws in daylight but in night light it looks much better than 1080p lcd display
"I bought this phone few days back , video quality is so bad that everything looks blur and ugly but the same video in other phone looks so neat and clear, contrast is so high that makes the video look of very cheap quality, camera is also not upto the mark doesn't look like a 64mp picture. Very disappointing, planning to return it"
"I had purchase this phone from amazon after using one month...
My experince Camera is good but not superb
Battery also good...
Display quality is poor 🙁
And if u want to play heavy game like pubg or cod then don't buy this phone many lagging issue..."
"After two month of use i am writing this review.
Sometimes it gives hanging problem (6 Gb ram 128Gb memory) (even 3.3Gb ram free 91Gb memory free) particularly in video play.
Oneday raining time i kept the phone in my pocket, little bit water gone inside.  Then i gave to service centre, phone touch and display gone, plus 2 chip also gone. All replaced (Rs.6000 spent). Still now the same hanging problem in this phone.  Now i feel i lost ( Rs.17000 + Rs6000).Rs.23000.
Before i have samsung J7 bought on 2013 (for Rs.17000) still that was good even i never changed my battery.  Now a days samsung products quality very bad.  SAMSUNG SHOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY ARE Indian products are Chinese products will be better in future."
Phone automatic not working.DISLIKE
Vry nice mobile I'm liked
"Older clientele (don't go here for a hip salon) but solid professionals who know how to cut hair without messing it up :) 

Thought it was a little weird getting water in a ceramic coffee mug...I think plastic cups or water bottles would be better."
"Excellent camera, trusted battery life and very very very fluid oxygen OS. 100% satisfactory product from OnePlus."
 Yes
"Phone is average
But battery drain issue very fast and sensor problem #backlight get on while you on call
#Wifi issue
Camera after update pie does not give you that much quality when it runs on oreo"
I love to Read  And i love Film making
Can`t wait for the next twitter.
"Samsung M20, such a unique device with an amazing Water drop notch. I personally loved the notch.
The battery life is eye popping. 5000 mah is not a small thing in such slim device. Its camera
performance is satisfying. The display is pretty good. The phone also doesn't weigh that much. Thus,
over-all such a budget phone it is. Camera has many unique features like portrait blur, etc. These
features are exemplary. The full HD display with a notch can make the device no better. Great Device it
is for people who are in search of a budget phone ."
"Good Mobile but not as other Chinese handsets like mi vivo real mi and cameras quality also
 Poor as compere mi and vivo.
Price also higher
Rating: cameras 3/5, battery 5/5, screen quality 4/5, sounds 4/5"
"Everything like; battery life, camera quality, fingerprint reader all are amazing !"
"Decent phone for daily usage ( mails , WhatsApp, feed , movies , songs, lite games ). Great display ( deep blacks ). Recommended for average Joe like me and not for heavy game players."
Nice phone
"Camera quality is too good if I charge for 1.5 hrs it will come for 2 days only one drawback is net consumption for 1 day it takes more than 2 gb
Over all phone is so great..many advertisement come to this phone this one point not satisfied and then always phone is good"
Very bad
"It's been 15 days since I got this phone. 10 days into using the phone and it is getting hanged. I asked for a replacement of the device from the Amazon customer care but there seems to be no response from them.
Completely unsatisfied and displeased with the phone and the Amazon customer care service."
Not better
It's hang very much and fingerprint sensor most time not work properly and camera quality is not like that as mentioned above
"Recd the phone yesterday. This is the best smart phone in this budget.
Battery takes 3hrs30min to completely charge. Quality of Both Camera is poor. Battery does well, lasts for atleast 30hrs.
Eye protection mode completely changes the display. So far good experience."
"What a crap airline!  If I could give them zero stars I would.  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.  The check-in people, gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt, the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late, it was the worst flying experience I've had.  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought I'd say ""Thank you US Airwarys"" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!  I will never fly United again!"
"Good looking phone

And All features"
I think i am getting a cold
Good mobile
"This mobiles  is hanging like anything
And please don't buy like this mobiles weast of Money"
"I am not happy with its performance, its volume is very low, weight also feels heavy, overall performance not up to the mark, disappointed, wanted to get rid of it."
"Phone has big problem of network,  while with same sim and network working absolutely fine in other phone but in M20 it has signal issue. I have tried with Airtel & Jio both. First time i thought this would be issue with one of the phone Amazon exchanged my phone with new device but same problem exists. Also google backup can't download in this phone. Battery is good but phone also has a heating issue. No earphone with. Camera is good. Just affordable nothing amazing."
"12:46AM. HAppy birthday little sister of mine. Also, good night Priscilla"
"Mid-priced dining with high end flavor. I ordered the special Yelp menu. Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing. Very good. Moved on the the ""smart"" chicken. Tender, char grilled breast with corn risotto. Yum!  Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme. Staff was friendly and very on top of things. Great experience.  I'm definitely coming back. give these guys some love!"
"Worst camera ever, good disply, and phone is handy, but totally disappointing camera both"
"A great experience every time we make it here.  Where else can you slide into the dining room?  We always have large groups and they are very accomodating, every table we've been at affords a beautiful view at sunset.  They try to make it a complete experience.
Servers are always very helpful and attentive.  Steaks are good and the sides are good if not very inventive.   The birthday dessert and cotton candy really cap off the dinners."
Good not great
"Worst, No use of 5000mah battery. I got this mobile to my mom. She use it very very light. But yet the charge is not lasting more than a day. I have used Mi, Azus, they are far better than this Samsung. other than the display and camera nothings is good in this phone. The phone internal performance is also very bad.

My end point is it is better to buy a Mi, Asus, Redme etc than this Samsung.
Samsung cheats in the name of its brand value but no customer satisfactions"
After 1 yr starts hanging like other samsung phones.....fingerprint is worst its just a dummy ....camera is average but front camera is worst...phone hangs occasionally....battery life is good.....better to go for nokia phones in this price range
safer to say that your cube is now a sphere ... but roll with it buddy ... it is an awesome time ... esp the 1st one
"I purchased this mobile because 6000MAH battery so don't need to buy power bank. First time use I charged 100% and tested. Unfortunately this mobile battery life is not  even 24 hours. I follow up my 30 customers around 2 hours.Updated Samsung software around 1 hour.I put sleep mode Samsung notified apps like whatsapp and uninstalled virus programs like movies,games,Ads which  don't  need middle class and poor people. That's all i used. I found out battery life is 20 hours for one time full charge. I will test again one more time after one month.Let see."

Face lock and finger lock security is very high speedy work....but camera is not a better. ..but I accept it in this price segment...
"Simply Awesome! I really had a confusin whether to go for Realme X2 Pro or OnePlus 7T. I took a wise decision by going with OnePlus 7T just for it Oxygen OS and for the brand name !

* Great Display
* Great Camera
* Great Battery Life. It charges 70% in just 30 Mins and 0-100% in 53 Mints

Cons / Which i feel should have made the device better are lack of Headphone Jack & Full Display Screen or a Punch hole camera would have been a great."
Very good

"*Is having a best fingerprint reader fast to open a lock .
*But camera is something missing I feel.
*The best battery life long time use.
*No heat on more than 3hours."
 Nice camera and finger print very super fast. But battery life not comfortable. Don't buy this item
"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok. 
This is a never return place for us. 
And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant.
The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."
Not bad

"Some family were in town and are Blackhawks fanatics desperate to watch the game.  This was the only place in the east valley that we could find had the NHL Center Ice package (though the girl who answered the phone had to ask somebody else (""What's NHL?"")).  Not only were they kind enough to put the game on, they put it on a flat screen in the corner of the patio and we were able to have the sound on.  He shoots, he scores!  

The shepherds pie was good, the beer was cold, and the waitress was very attentive.

I'll stick with CK's or the Baseline Pub for the NFL games though.  While RT's had plenty of TV's, most of them were small old tube TV's.  My uncle asked why they weren't showing the score of a basketball game, and I told him it's just being cut off by the old TV's screen"

"Definitely not a good camera phone. Poor quality pictures in day time. Don't think about night pictures, it is worse than a 5k phone result.
Network issues. 4G is not working like a 4G and it feels like 3G."
"I suggest don't buy this phone because this phone is waste of money instant you can buy redmi note 8 or note 8 pro or realme 5 pro or realme XT for best smartphone under 15,000 rupees and you can check the review on YouTube also."
"Dont buy this total waste of money & Totally Unsatisfied with this Product,
1. Gets very heated when u turn on the Torch even for 5-10 min.
2. Camera quality is also pathetic.
3. Network is major issue in this model, need to refresh the network every 10-15 min in a Day.
4. Battery back up is average not like 5000 MAH batteris.
5. Also gets Hanged every time while coming out of application.
6. Face unlock is not working properly."
Product good camera good but one thing that not good that is 3000 mAh battery that reduces it charm and for the battery no optimisation show from the side of Xiaomi.. so please work on it
it is worth buying this at sub 10k. easy to carry and photos are beautiful and original.
Fingerprint scanner is slow n not smooth in comparison of other brand.. and camera quality is ok ok n colours shows very dull but buttery life is good
"camara quality is very bad iam not happy this phone ...very bad phone

2.  Superclean and comfortable rooms.
3.  Excellent amenities and top notch spa.

2.  KEEP THE POOL BAR OPEN LATER! MY GOD!!!  I'd like to watch the sun set with a cocktail, rather than have the sidewalk rolled up around 5."
"Good for oldage, not for technical adults..
I suggest Samsung to removed their useless cluttering apps, instead use clean os so it is ok to be an exynos processor, no need of snapdragon if Samsung utilizes stock Android type removing all Samsung apps..."
Don't buy this mobile.it drops signals frequently .I tried with all top networks  the problem  is the same slow internet. I visited  Samsung  service  centre they said they will be looking  into it .if problem  continues. Worst phone when signals are considered.network frequency is very poor.i think they should fix with an update.

"In short - Jen rocks!

Finding someone I trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nerve-wracking.  I came across Jen's Pet Sitting while searching for options, since I'm relatively new to the area.  

I decided to book a consultation with Jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services.  Jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters.  It was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them.  

After having a great experience with Jen during the consult I booked her to do visits over a long weekend.  The hubs and I took our dogs along for the trip and Jen looked after our cats while we were away. She gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone.  Sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus!  Jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous.

I always know I've found a wonderful petsitter when I come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me!  We will definitely continue to use Jen in the future."
All are excellent

Horrible product it worked well for 1 month now it is not working at all. Such a waste of money on this. Once the most trusted brand Samsung has continuously lead down the expectations of the customers. Will never buy any Samsung product in life and will not recommende to buy.
"Review after 2 months of use.
What a product delivered by OnePlus, truly value for your every penny.
Awesome camera with top notch Macro mode.
Standby battery life is now improved after recent update.
Screen is really butter with 90hz.
CPU Performance is flawless, played Asphalt 9, call of duty, mortal Kombat at a time still running smoothly without heating.
Go for it guys!!!"

Average product.
"Touch and fingerprint sensor was somewhat slow as compared to other phones. Say, xiaomi note 5.
5000 mah battery doesn't make any edge over 4000 mah. Moreover, phone was somewhat heavier to hold due to large battery."
Only Camera is good otherwise phone is average
"Good product but its need software updates, in camera"
welcome  ! since it seems you`re interested in cheese I hardly suggest you to follow  too
"Samsung has launched this product at a very aggressive price.
Targeting the 10-12k segment, it has delivered the product very nicely to meet the expectation completely.
It has a strong battery backup with 5000mAh battery which delivers your expectation for an entire day.
Design and screen quality is same as what Samsung is best at.
The games and app runs smoothly.
Overall a very good product by Samsung at such an affordable price."

"After driving by this place about a million times I finally remembered it when the old ""Where shall we go to eat"" question came up and I am now definitely a fan. I asked the server (Chico - he was great and seemed to really love working there) about his recommendations and tried the Salmon Spinach Enchilada which will be difficult to move on from when I go back. It was absolutely amazing and I tried my hardest to finish my plate. Only reason I did not give this place five stars is that the ambiance in the back room was a bit lacking. It was more cafeteria-styled and just not very warm and inviting.
Regardless, I know that I will be back and definitely introduce this place to out of town guests!"

"Very much satisfied with the phone. New software  update received few days back. Operation has become more convenient and soft. Multi tasking is very much easy. You can open and operate numerous apps at the same time. Samsung brand value will add to your personality.

Go for it without any hesitation."

"Good value for money. Bought in Amazon big billion sale for my Mom getting good value for an old product and she's totally loving it.
I was also looking for Samsung M30s but it doesn't have any screen protection and also it failed in one of the drop test. Moreover there was no good deal for exchanging on the same so had to go with this. And trust me using 1st time oppo, I wouldn't regret it."

Other wise its good"

"My personal suggestion that please don't purchase Samsung galaxy M30, there are many issues like.. Audio issue, Hanging problem.... I think Samsung stop the quality check prosses... I give 1 star for cemera and battery only...."
How will I give you for battery life? It depends on the life of the battery.

It's full of bugs and specifications give not working properly
"So much food to choose from on the menu! They have so many options (healthy eater,unhealthy eater,  vegetarian, breakfast, lunch, etc)  for every kind of diner.

Only the display heart me alot.
I didn't recommend this phone only because of its built quality of Display.
It really hurts me alot."
Not as much as expected as many market players are cheaper than this

Battery quality is too week. Once you set your phone on silent mode it's don't active Normal mode. After restart phone it will activate
"Phone is truly a beast with all latest tech built within.
Built quality - 10/10 with fine detailed finishing and sturdy device. Waterdrop notch i like it personally. But does not have notification lights(i personally prefer to have it).

Camera - quality has improved drastically after latest update. Images are too good just loved it. Can be improved with some ar stickers and stuff to add fun element in camera.

Android 10 OS - OS is a bit buggy where application and touch hangs abrubtly and issue is intermittent but definitely annoying, as least you would you expect is smooth experience with software part after paying 39999₹ for the device. I think one plus have pushed android 10 bit early just for releasing updated oneplus 7t phone. They might resolve the issue with software upgrades.

Sound - 10/10 Experience is very good with and without headphones. Phone comesnwith dual speaker and provides truly stereo effect.

Battery - 7/10
Battery charging is very quick with warp charging but it drains thatbquickly as well with minimal usage. It hardly lasts for me upto 20-24 hours(which i say is less from my past exp with other phones having similar battery capacity and non amoled display)

Display - 10/10 You will definitely fall in love with the amoled display and video viewing experience is simply superb."

"Meh, I'm not completely sold.

It's so much smaller than a traditional B&N and they did not have anything I was looking for. Nevermind any of the school related supplies I would have like to seen.

I don't think I'll come back here, I'll make my way to Borders (yada yada as you will). I won't be going to the next nearest B&N (Tempe) because I don't have a car and the energy just isn't worth it."
Note 8 is simply ASM I liked it camera photo are detailed.....and delivered fastlu this wat consumer expect ..tqs to Amazon for this amazing product...but there were issue in buying this product because of lightning deals
"It's too good phone. I am loving it 😍
Camera quality is best. Night Mode, macro mode, wide angle are really nice.
Front camera with 32MP is at it's best. Even if you zoom the photo taken by front am, to the fullest, pixels are pretty clear, no blur or image damge.
It's too much value for Money. Must buy if you want have a really good ph at this budget 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻
I am actually promoting, recommending this phone to family members!"

"One month in use
One of the best phones in the market right now.
Pros
Screen is the usp about this phone. Amazing screen ratio with Amoled display which enhances the view.
Battery is also excellent with fast charge
Camera is a 4 out of 5 for this price range

Cons
No earphones in the box
Only comes in gradient color on the back"
"Everything is good about this phone... One thing that that could have been better is battery, although it has a decent battery that will last for a day still there's alot of room for improvement.

PS* Charger is amazingly fast. And it covers for battery. 👍"
most of the apps dont get installed or dont work

"-Camera and sound is just awesome (don't have to say much)
-The display is smooth and best
- battery should be more but fast charging will do the job
- just to know it's little big(vertically) from other mobiles..some times wont to fit in the pocket but in hand, it feels normal size

just disappointed with the amazon delivery.. worst experience ever"

"The name sounds like the name of some guns the Army uses. The camera is too good and shoots pictures like an automatic gun. Sharp, accurate and automatic mode is lovely. Too many phone features. Lots of customisation options. Overall a beautiful looking phone that is a great below Rs 15,000-/ without any competition. Just go for it. With every penny."
Phone is very very slow since day one.

Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.

"One plus is going to be one of the most recommended phone in android but there are many points it’s disappointing
1. Camera is good but not outstanding, i dnt know why but i never impress with the picture quality
2. Design, worst design ever, like they have just copied nokia lumia serise
3. Battry could be higher.
4. Could offer atleast 2.5 jack connector at this price"

Pros - good picture quality
Good touch
Fingerprint sensor is good
Sound quality is great
Cons - too much SAR value which really can harm in longer run
Battery is very poor
The most unavoidable issue is network problem, network comes and go. This is the only reason I will sale this phone after 3 months.
You should other options if planning to buy a phone. Will not recommend this."

Battery life is amazing it comes atleast 2 days for 2 days for a single charge. Worth every penny spent.

Good camera quality
battery life good"
"I was a tad disappointed. That could have been because, with all the hype surrounding the M20, I was expecting a lot more from it than I got. I've got the Samsung Galaxy S8 as well so the quality of the M20 doesn't come anywhere close to the S8.
The M20 isn't a bad phone. In fact, I think it's a good phone. It just isn't a GREAT phone."
Over all phone is good but  both cameras are not so good . Mi 48 mp camera  is batter then Samsung.

basically the phone offers all those things which one can find in a 8k phone. there is no point in spending an extra 3-4 k on this phone."

"One of the best smartphones in the market, even I would say it is the best of them. I will not write here much about the phone The people who are well aware about OnePlus will love it definitely.

After purchase, I had a payment related issue with Amazon and my bank but the service provided by Amazon and the solutions provided by them were excellent.

Highly recommended!"

"note: the 5 stars i'm giving this place is for their happy hour menu, not the regular menu. if you order off the regular menu no amount of advice can help you.



M&S has to have one of the best happy hours in the world, aside from Spearmint Rhino. $3 drafts and a rotating $2 bar food menu, such as 1/2 lb. burger with fries, hot wings, fish tacos, beef taquitos, etc. don't order the fish chilli though, it tastes like A1 sauce. they got a lot of winners on tap, like kiltlifter, guinness, bass, fat tire, pyramid hefe, etc.



happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius. make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget. BUZZKILL."

"5000 Mah battery will make your smile infinite.
The powerful high speed fingerprint sensor in the classic style rear side will make you unique among other brand users colleagues.

Excellent
Excellent display at this point. Extremely happy with the phone.
"After using it for a month I must say it has that speedy response, superb camera, fingerprint reader is WoW. Battery life doesn't last long due to 90hz refresh rate but yes it would give you 15-18 hrs of usage after full charge. Better than costly Apple and Samsung."
I like this phone so much😍Samsung say its megamonster what i think it is more than Megamonster😀Phone look is so good and camera quality awesome😍👌.Overall I have to say Thanxxx Samsung for providing such a Valuable smartphone in this so good range🙏😍😍😍😍 What we needed in a Smartphone everything in it😀

"Before going to buy this product let me tell some truth... Camera is at it's worst, after buying this  phone  I got 2 updates and last one specific for camera  but still it's same as before after updateScreen quality  just like a normal lcd panel phone , I switched from pixel XL but that was my biggest mistake I can say that.Now the funniest thing is my phone's front camera taking 15-20 second to popup and Amazon tech support says that's normal 😁😁. Amazon says no return policy is there for this phone so yeah you are going to regret after buying this piece of junk, don't listen to the YouTubbers they are just paid for that.

"We came there on November 5, 2011 and the service was very bad. The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit. We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit. 

We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers. 

Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice."
"Cave Creek is a well-manicured muni, featuring a straight-forward layout, nice practice area and large putting green.  There are some elevation changes and some bunkering that add some challenge, but overall it's a pretty easy course.

Some of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#1 handicap).  #11 is a par 5 that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.  

Most of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There aren't any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.  The driving range desperately needs new balls, but the course is a solid three stars."
It's ok

Product is good but Amazon service is very bad suggest don't buy any product from Amazon.

"Best thing -- Camera ,display, touch..

Bad- no expandable memory and only 11gb for user but u have to keep 1-2 gb free else phone becomes slow
Worst- Frustrating customer care, it was ok for me for first 10 months,then chariging issue came, so i went customer care now they told me wo wait for 1 month for spare part.

Over all everything is perfect in this phone after using 2 month I didn't face any issue. Camera is really & Performance is really good.
The main disadvantage I feel about its face unlock system. because  it unlock with the face of another user also. Please fix this issue.

Nice with this budget
"The phone is heavy and definitely meets its long lasting power backup challenge. But it has a serious set back when camera performance is taken to count.
I have compared camera with my 2 to 3 year old mobile which was also within 15k range which gave better photo results."
Worst phone. touch screen works automatically but when i need to operate with touch sometimes its not worked. Network strength also poor.

"I don't often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place.
The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. 

In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review. 

I am not planning a return anytime soon."

The battery back up of the phone is ultimate and I spend 1 and half day without any powerbank on standby mode on touring. The plastic back of the phone might be not like by most of the user as the fingerprint can easily seen. However, it's a good phone to us especially when SAMSUNG associated with"

Cons:
-Poor speaker
-Modem has an issue, network strength and call quality.This is due to Exynos 9611 processor. Snapdragon performs better
-Slow charging even though its a 2A/5V 10W charger
-No screen casting

In the same price range you have other phines that perform better than this. This was not worth the money spent."
Horrible product. The touch screen went blank in 16 days and Samsung refuses to replace. The service desk says that the phone should have been brought back the day it blanked out. Since the phone was not brought to the help desk within 1r days they will not replace. Disappointing product and equally worse after care.

"I'm so happy they put a location in Old Town.  I had been to the location in South Phoenix before and it was awesome as well.  

I had the Chopped BBQ which is Turkey, Chicken, and Beef all chopped up and cooked in BBQ sauce.  It was very very tasty.  They gave me two pieces of bread to make a sandwich and with the 1/2lb order I still had more left over.  

For my side I got the Texas Cream Corn which I really enjoy.  It has great flavor and is an excellent compliment to the BBQ.  

The location has a nice patio for the great weather we are having and you can also sit inside on picnic style tables."

"Ahh what a nice place to let your four legged friend run free! This park is huge, spacious, lots of trees, benches (for the two legged friends) and trash cans. One of the best  bark parks in the Valley. Not too many complaints other than the jerks who refuse to pick up after the doggies. People please, they have pooper scoopers, baggies, and trash cans, it couldn't be easier. Oh, and if you have an aggressive dog, maybe take him for a walk outside instead of letting killer on the loose in the park. My Golden is notorious for being over friendly and ran up to a huuuuge bull mastiff (I shall not name names, but it rhymes with bing!) grabbed my golden by the neck and pinned him down till we removed the mastiff off. Anyway, point it... it's a dog friendly park... let's keep it that way. Oh and another reason to keep the kiddies out, I think there's even a sign posted up there. I see kids running up to dogs over petting, grabbing tails, etc... not a good idea. Read the signs parents, it's for your own benefit. So bring your dogs here, they'll have a blast playing, running, smelling this and that, good times."

2. Heating problem.
3. while mobile is in our pocket, it's screen got appeared after lock the screen."
Worst product. Phone hanging problem.
Good enough speed whil finger print reading and camera quality is awesome but need software enhancements as texture getting smooth in some scenarios. And about battery its great easily get for a typical user but I personally think that it need some enhancements on software side as I use xiaomi mobile previously it has 4500 mah battery . Both performances looking so similar.

"The major thing to consider this device is it's a android one device and another one is its cameras...regular cam which is 48mp and another two are wideangle and depth sensors...cameras are good it takes good pictures in day light in indoor lighting conditions also it takes better pictures where as in low light it performed better than as i expected it takes nice shots in low light conditions thanks to the f 1.8 aperture which allows more light to capture nice shots in the night...video quality is ok not that great....by default you can take the shots in 12mp...but there is a option to choose 48mp both in photo and pro mode....sound quality is good if you have nice pair of headphones you can get good sound from.the earphones.where as coming yo loud speaker it didn't my expectations...my previous device mi a1 has good loud speaker....and one of the major advantage with mi a3 is its compactness...yes the phone easily fits in your hand even though it is a 6""inch device you wont feel that it is a 6"" device....coming to screen quality it is ok..even though it is a super amoled display due to the screen resolution i.e., 720...you feel disappointed if they would have given the 1080 screen it would have been great....finally if you are looking to buy a good compact and solid build quality device go for mi a3 you wont get disappointed...except if you love big screens and high resolution displays...."
This is my third vivo bought in one yearQuality of camera is good
Amazing battery life that last for 2days with heavy usage... Camera is not beyond expectation...

"I received a defective Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon. When I am trying to turn on , it boots to the logo then goes to the ""Samsung M30 powered by Android "" screen, then it stays there. I've tried to do a hard reset by holding down the power button and the volume up button and have done reboot and still gets hung on the ""SAMSUNG M30 "" logo. I contact customer services of amazon but they also failed and arranged a Technician visit. After 2 days, Technician agent verify the mobile and reported to Amazon about this problem. After that amazon send a replacement unit to my address. Amazon transport service agent come my address and say that after verification mobile will be replace. Agent trying to turn on the device to get IMEI no. How is this possible? Phone already dead/hung at samsung logo. Agent said that if he saw IMEI number on mobile screen, then replacement will done. I contact customer services about this matter but no solution. Replacement is rejected by amazon transport agent . I saw order details in my amazon app, it shows replacement unit rejected by customer 🙄. I surprised about the service provided by amazon. There is no connection between amazon customer support, Amazon Transport agent, amazon app but managed Amazon india😆😆. All unit are managed by amazon but there is no connection and understanding between them. I think for mobiles flipkart is best and services provided by them is also great. Please do not purchase mobile phones from Amazon. Services provided by amazon is really worst. For this reason 95% of new Mobile phone lunched on flipkart. When purchase mobile phones on Amazon, think twice."
Average phone
I like camera.battery. everything in this mobile

"I am disheartened with this phone. Hung multiple times in tenure of a month..can't attach pictures on WhatsApp to share, always get stuck and the screen get freezed."
"Worst expected from samsung.....
The touch response is very bad...
The phone lags alot
Camera quality is also bad"
"It does not work properly
Instantly becomes very hot
All apps Start working on their own
In case something happens company will be responsible for that"
"Totally its good.
Camera is impressive.
Touch screen is sensitive.
Battery life is short.
Cannot use mobile 24 hours even in full charge
High price, no yield for that amount"
"Bought a great pair of their 'eddie' ballet flats here on sale...deal. This store gives good...customer service that is. They noticed my sunglass case was a little too old and gave me a new one of theirs...lovely. I returned a few weeks later during their friends and family night and purchase a different color of the same shoe...perfect for traveling and the lovely shaded purples ones will be a great pop of color with my comfy and neutral travel clothes!

Hey if you see that girl walking by the Seine in Paris with the purple shoes...it's me!"
"I'd have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly.  I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee.  I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten, after paying....and the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times.  I'm a neighbor, but will never go here again!!!!"

"This phone has an amazing processor, the Octa core exynos 7904 is just perfect for playing high end games like pubg and asphalt 9 in HD. The camera is a key feature the rear camera is packed with and awesome dual camera set up of 13+5 megapixel with f/1.9 and f/2.2 respectively. The front camera is 8 megapixel with f/2.0 and I must say it's really amazing. This device runs on Android 8.1 oreo and has interface of Samsung Experience 9.5 UX and it's really smooth. Another major key feature of this phone is its 5000 mah battery which easily lasts all day even after heavy usage. The type c fast charger is also really good I mean it charges really quick. The phone is impressively fast and in this range one would barely find phone with such brilliant features. This phone also has fingerprint sensor on it's back just beside the dual camera setup. The fingerprint unlock is also really fast. Also the device comes with a powerful 4gb ram and 64 GB internal storage which is more than enough for me atleast and if not that then there's am expandable memory upto 512gb .Its really amazing phone in this range. I recommend this phone."
I has recent purcahsed brand mobile before 5 day.

Device is Not working
Phone with 4 gb ram and 64 gb internal storage is running slower than a 2gb ram and 8gb storage phone. Perfectly done samsung. Product looks good but can barely complete the functions of calling and typing without significant lag.
"Phone over all  quality is very good
The was not too light or too weight..
Very good performance and fast actions."
"This mobile is totally use less,only one month display error.......so please do not provide this items to other person."

"4 stars for the patrons that attended. good looking, generally friendly, and hardly any douchebags.
2 stars for the cleanliness. I was there last night for a reserved, catered party and even though the food had run it's course on the patio, nobody cleaned it up. fantastic decor coupled with disgusting expired looking food
2 stars for the bar service. ordered drinks three times and despite being at the barfront, it took 15mins each time to get a drink - which was generally underserved and overpriced. and this wait time wasnt just because sex girls were getting served... the bartenders were just that poor
3 stars for the ambiance. music, staff, mood of the club. 
2.75 stars overall. with places similar to this such as mabels and az88, i prob wouldnt go back to this place unless invited."
Just love the mobile 😍😍 it's camera is just awesome ❤ it's screen is also bigger compared to other mobiles ... Just perfect for me ... I loved everything about this phone ... Worth buying 😘 I highly recommend to buy this phone

The number of magazine and newspaper readers remained unchanged .
Not good as per advertisement
Don't buy this mobile.it drops signals frequently .I tried with all top networks  the problem  is the same slow internet. I visited  Samsung  service  centre they said they will be looking  into it .if problem  continues. Worst phone when signals are considered.network frequency is very poor.i think they should fix with an update.
Like this product but after some time hanging problem in this device
Very best . Using very smart
Don't trust any reviews .Such a wonderfull mobile😍.BEAST of speed. Wonderfull camera.fastest face unlock and fingerprint scanner.apreciable battery backup.An alrounder😎

"My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat. Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had!! 

1. The people that work there are AMAZING. They are so nice and hospitable, always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want. (romantic date, take out, quick bar eats, etc.) 

2. This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix. I don't know how they find half of the stuff the serve, but they do, and it is just off the boat. (I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms) 

3. Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present.

"Let me first say if I could have given 0 stars I would have.

My wife and I went to this place and were EXTREMELY disappointed. We had gone to a different Pancho's many years ago and were hoping it would be like that. The choices were very very limited and basic. There are so many amazing Mexican dishes yet my only choices were a tamale,taco and some horrible tasting enchiladas. How does a Mexican food place not offer burritos...have you guys heard of a bean burrito? Its pretty popular and would be a good choice to offer.

The only food here that is worth eating is the baby churros and the Sopapillas, which actually were good. Unfortunately I didn't go to this place to pay $20 so my wife and I can eat Sopapillas. 

Please listen to my advice when I tell you to avoid this place. Take your money to taco bell and get a lot better Mexican food at a fraction of the cost."

"FANTASTIC little lunch/brunch spot! Went here with the family while visiting Scottsdale and really enjoyed it! 

We had the Tuna Melt, which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese! 
The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS! 

The omelets and scrambles looks great - I didn't taste, but then again, there was nothing left on the plate! LOL 

Smaller place so could be busy during peak hours, may call or try and hit an off time. Service was ok, wasn't anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot!"
Good experience vivo
"Best phone in this price with Samsung brand tag..
5000 mAh battery and fast charge best thing so no hectic like my previous phone
Camera quality nice
Screen resolution good
Sound good"
Excellent
"I used to LOVE this place.  It was fun, vibrant and hip and the food was pretty good.  The calamari salad with arugula was da bomb and still is.  The food was definitely better when it first opened.    If you drink enough alcohol to ignore the miserable wait staff then it's not so bad.  The wait staff are unprofessional and could give 2 rats about your dining experience; but all you have to do is tip accordingly and hopefully they'll shape up.  There are way too many places in Scottsdale to return here.  I think I will give it one more shot.  It is a shame b/c the food is pretty decent."
Nice its perfomormce also good but this phone is heating during use....... Camera improvement is good..
This is my favorite of the Yard House restaurants and not just because it is on my side of town.  The food always seems to be done just right and my husband and his sister enjoy the beer.  Would have given one more star but my husband has yet to find any food item that makes him want to go here over some other restaurant.  Since I just can't seem to get enough of the grilled cheese and tomato bisque soup it is very disappointing that he doesn't want to go.
It is totally waste of money. Very poor camera and amazon is not returning the product
The total value of the deal is USD 29mn .
Wow! The Penang Curry (chicken) was absolutely incredible!! The portion was huge...had enough left over for another meal and tasted just as good the 2nd day. I will definitely be back! The Thai Tea was very good also. I just wish it was closer to Gilbert!

"If you are a beer snob, stay at home trying to make it yourself.  If you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot.  The owner used to be a brew-master at Four Peaks Brewery which is a local favorite in Tempe.  

I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.    

The food is always good.  It is a bar so don't expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I haven't been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold."
"Battery is good.
Camera pic quality is not so good n net running very slow as i have told already to coustmer srvce agent. I observed sa. Samsung galaxy m20 model is having problm for slow net runing while at same place, same network in other phone ,net runing good n fast.
Email set up is not happing in this m20 unlike other sets.
But i have lack of time so this time i will not return the product.
But i will suggest to my near n dear to not purchase m20 samsung galaxy.

Thnx."

"what the hell am i doing awake this early,"
"being a rather simpleton, i like my salads with lettuce, tomato, and oil and vinegar...my fish simply baked...my veggies raw....

the ice cream here was very tasty. full of fancy flavors and bits-o-ingredients. but i guess if you want plain ice cream, you go to the supermarket and buy a gallon of store brand. we were cruising the greenbelt at night and saw their sign for ""voted best ice cream"" by the new times, so we decided to hit this place up. it's super cute and modern, but what's so great about this place is the staff. 
our ""server"" was completely into the concept of ""artisan"" ice cream (only in scottsdale can a word like artisan be applied to ice cream...it's not simply ""homemade""). she was super passionate and lively and gregarious, which i really like...because i know she's serving a product she enjoys herself and also wants others to enjoy. 

i had the peach cobbler one and my girl had the basil sorbet. both were very delicious, but at over 6 bucks for 2 small cups, we'll probably have to save our dollars for the supermarket next time. if you have the cash to spare for a snack/dessert, check this place out."
"Totally waste of money.signal receiving capacity of the phone is very weak,alaways disconnecting calls.3 times visited service center but problem is same"
Bad product
"The phone comes with 128gb that gives decent storage. The stunning display is full screen and so detailed and precise. The triple camera concept is marvelous with amazing clarity beating the top camera phones or professional cameras in the market and same goes for the front camera as the selfies come out clean and makes everyone look so good. The battery life is the best thing as it comes along with 5000 mAh that makes it run through out the day and is beneficial during vacations as I plan to go on trips with my family and play PUBG throughout the day. All in all Im in love with my phone and if you're planning to buy a phone under 18,000 then this is definetly the best pick"

"I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement.

I have to assume it's called a ""Coffee Lab"" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  It's all about the coffee, plain and simple.

Then again, there's really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really won't want to drink it (until you do, then you're happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  I've only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term ""Lab"" is because they've actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything I've come across before.

Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on the other places.  It's not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you'd use on the place anyway...

I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly don't care.  Their coffee is excellent and I'll be coming back for more."

"This is just overall a great place! It's tough to do this review, as I can probably only remember 1/2 of my times being here, and that is being generous. 
There's something about the atmosphere here that just makes you want to tie one on and knock back giant beers and spend money playing songs, darts, and Golden Tee. They also have pool and other games. 
It's a BIG bar. There is a more ""game side"" and a more ""table/eating side"". They have a ton of TV's that are large and high quality. I have never seen it ""slow"" here. It seems no matter what the day or time it's pretty happening! 
The food is really good. I love the diverse menu, happy hour specials, and quality ingredients. I also have never once had bad service. The staff is fast, friendly, and has never seemed irritated or overwhelmed. 
There is a large patio out front that you can drink on that has misters and heat lamps (depends on the season). 
This is the absolute perfect place to go have a blast with friends, or even come alone when you feel the need for a night out. Always friendly, attentive, and..... oops I forgot the rest because I always end up giggly and drunk. Sigh."

"I had very high expectations for The Breakfast Joynt because so many gave it 5 stars, which means ""As good as it gets, Woohoo!"" according to Yelp.  My experience didn't live up to that but I'm willing to give them another try.

This location was formerly a bar that was transformed into a breakfast restaurant.  The actual bar is still there, with a flat panel TV in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling.  They've only been there around 6 months, so maybe this will change as they settle into the location.  It has a very clean, upscale feel to it - something not out of place in North Scottsdale.  It's also easy to find once you're off the 101 onto Raintree, and then north on Northsight... it's on the right and shares parking with Gold's Gym that is easily seen from the road.

I found the eggs to be good, and recommend steering towards the omelet choices.  Being from the South, it wasn't thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and they've informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic.

Menu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.  I thought the description of ""ham that falls off the bone"" was repeated far too many times.

Prices were very reasonable for Scottsdale.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent.  Owners are very concerned about customers with less than a stellar dining experience, so I'll be sure to give the Breakfast Joynt another try with friends and family."

"Reviewing this product after almost a year later first of all pros
1.camera is surprisingly Amazing no one can compete
2.look is dam awesome and sleek though
3.pubg is running smoothly at hd high
4.screen quality is awesome
Now here starts cons

2.battery life is 3 hours from 100-0
3.heating is there when playing pubg
4.android one is still laggy and not optimized
Update:::But if you get this one at 7k then go for it nothing beats it. Its a awesome one piece
Please hit helpful mark below for encourage me to post more reviews ☺️"
Amazing guys...... go for it .... fully satisfied
highly recommonded to buy display is fine and battery backup more than 1 day for game lover. there is no lagging runs smooth only camera is average which causes problem in low light . overall it is best in this price range no one stand before it in this price range and quality.

"I've had Five Guys before while in Pennsylvania and thought it was good. Not any better or worse then In-Out or Fatburger. Tried this location the other night though and was disappointed. Lettuce was slimey,buns soggy and the doneness of the patties, inconsistent.  I'm not completely writing them off but will be in no huge rush to return."
Worst product

"At Rs6499, you wont ever get this kinda screen resolution.
The camera is decent,battery backup is very good. I'm VERY IMPRESSED for its overall performance."
the quality of the phone is toooo much waste......it is not returnable. and now am thonking i have wasted money in something waste....... Camera is really a waste. Battery drains too fast. I dnn even use it so much.
Awesome cellphone.. everything better in this cellphone.. Camera quality 10x zoom with clearing. Battery charging also awesome.
For given processer and RAM I didn't expect this phone to have laggy UI(may be because of Samsung's customized OS). I never seen any phone this  much laggy around this price range or even 3k or 4k less this. Display is very good and it's main selling point.
Nice mobile for this price

"We had a fun, early dinner on the patio here at BoomBozz.  The advertised happy hour specials appeared to be a very good value; my fave was the soft pretzels & cheese.  I also had the wedge salad and it was excellent - they don't skimp on the blue cheese!  My son had the pepperoni pizza and even his discriminating palate was very happy.  A crisp blonde draft (for me) and ice cream (for him) polished us off and we left full & happy."

Battery life is so good.

Issue is with the battery and the jack.

Product is ok ok but there is no headphones with the same...
"After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention:
1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it.
2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight.
3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick.
4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi.
  I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone.
To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi.
Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range."
if ur as awesome as i think u are u would sooo write me back  a lil something   <--- crossing fingers
The simple perfect phone!!!..the only downside is Snapdragon 665. But that is not much of a deal-breaker.

"Juan Jaime's is where the simple taste of Mexico are served with delectable results.  The kitchen produces vibrant fiesta flavors that left me wanting more.

If you go ask for the Grilled Mahi Mahi.  You'll thank me later.  I can't wait to go back."

"i am very much disappointed by Samsung pls don't buy this phone i will tell u why not to buy this phone
i ordered this phone twice in the sale of amazon and both the time there was a problem with the phone
on my first purchase, the display was not properly fixed to the phone and on second purchase the fingerprint was not proper the quality of the phone is worst then some Chinese phone out there in the market
because of the sale and limited stock samsung is not doing the quality check on the phone
i will recommend you to go for iphone 6 which is 100 times better then this phone yes the display is good but i think u r not buying a phone only for display. think  before u waste your 15000"

"Ok i have bought this product during first sell event.
I received the product and checked it out.
First i open the camera and it's start lagging i was disappointed then i called the Amazon customer service. They  suggest me to do a format of phone and i formatted it then it start working fine.
but *talking about camera*🤔
Idk how can redmi say that the phone have 48mp camera😔 but the night mode was good and we can't zoom in 48mp camera option & if you're going to buy this phone for camera purpose i Will not suggest you to buy this i (you can better phones in this price like realme 3pro ,redmi note 7s etc.)

 you can go for it if u r buying it for normal use (like small games not for camera purpose)😉

Battery performance was good though.😃
Display is outstanding😄

Overall I'll rate it 7/10 😕"

@CharlotteAbotsi maybe because they weren't asked about it? #stayontopic #gopdebate
Not so good
"I've always wanted to go here.  The flames outside intrigued me.  So we went on Wednesday night around 8pm.  We were sat fairly quickly with no reservations for habachi.  Music is pumping, and the crowd is a bit older/slightly cougarish.

The service was...OK. He went missing from time to time.  He brought me a diet coke after I had only taken a few sips out of my glass.  I must of gotten 4 new glasses by the end of the meal.

Soup....is your basic mushroom miso soup.
Salad...Tasty, spicy, had a nice kick.  Fresh crunchy greens.
Fillet and Chicken....Eh....I found the flavors lacking, the steak a little chewy, and the chicken boring.  Even the dipping sauces were lacking.

74 for dinner plus tip for two.  I think you can get better elsewhere.  Not worth the drive down to Scottsdale, find a local joint closer to home."
"Very good experience with low cost...  Mobile finishing also very good, camere quality also fine... Like this mobile"
Excellent phone
"It has good battery life , plus the camera is super amazing , has slomo super slomo as well as time lapse , dark mode . It does not have s secure which normally other samsung phones have , but i hope the next update will have it .

"I've eaten here one time, and I enjoyed a very decent meal.  I'm not really sure if I'll go back though, and I'll tell you why.  The place kind of gave me a strange vibe:

-It didn't *feel* like a restaurant, it almost felt like a business that had turned into a restaurant.

-The take-out menu/brochure was worded pretty peculiarly in places.

-This one's hard to explain, but I sort of sensed some very subtle yet unsettling religious undertones throughout the whole experience.

Had the China wrap.  It was kinda good, even if it did taste like homemade American teriyaki.  In a spinach tortilla.  With a side of yogurt.  --*sigh* Do you see what I mean?  A funny vibe.  I can't quite shake it.  Maybe I'll give it one more chance."
Overall good phone in this prize.
"According to Finnish Metso Minerals , the value of the company 's orders has gone up to EUR 1.9 bn in 12 months ."
"Worst phone and product by Samsung, within 2 months screen got damaged and now camera is not working since motherboard of the phone is damaged. In service center they are telling they can't repair as it doesn't comes under any warranty."
"Camera is not as good as described.
Overall performance is good and camera lighting can be fixed with a software update.
In night with low light performance is not upto the mark"
Nice phone in budget

"I ALWAYS pay in cash at this Panda's. If it wasn't across the street from work, I wouldn't go here at all.

Fair warning."

"The time was 4:30am.  It was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up.  Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.

There were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.

Occasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.

Then something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.

Yes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  

Of course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.  Thanks for taking the ass out of Christm."

"I think the high reviews of Sofrita must simply be a function of the limited dining options in Fountain Hills as this is the worst excuse for tapas that I've ever had.  We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake.

I ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  I've never had a ""roasted"" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato.

The atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.  

While I love tapas style dining, if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was, I would gladly forego the experience.  Needless to say, we won't be back."

"Indulge Burgers got a few things right and a few things wrong, but overall, I was very pleased with my experience. We had a Living Social deal, and got the sweet potato and regular fries combo, as well as a side salad to start. The fries were good, but nothing special. The salad made me want to cry. I know you don't go to a burger joint to get a salad, but couldn't you at least try to make it a decent salad? It was all white lettuce and a few sprigs of sliced carrots. My husband wanted me to give the place 3 stars for the lettuce alone. But, the burgers themselves were good, and the Build-Your-Own was a really good deal. There is good variety on the toppings, cheese, sauces and buns to choose from. My turkey patty was huge - it was overflowing out of the English muffin. 

Some plusses: the service was really, really excellent. One of the best servers I've ever had. Also, while we were waiting for our table, the owner/manager came around and offered everyone samples of margarita. Since I'm pregnant and couldn't try the sample, he said I got a free milkshake. After we were seated and he was walking around, he made sure our server knew that he had offered a free milkshake and made good on the promise! That was so cool. I left totally stuffed and very satisfied."

"We had our first experience on a Friday night about 6:30. The servers were pleasant.  Wild Thaiger has a nice patio dining facing Central, but it was a little too hot and they didn't have a misting system. The inside was clean with a combo bar and open kitchen. 

We started with the Freshie Rolls with warm Peanut Sauce and Lychee Martini. Nice, but not the best in town (Pure Sushi Bar has a to die for Lychee Lemon Drop).  

The entrees are huge and could easily be shared. We had the Kimow - hot and spicy clear noodles, chicken, broccoli, snow peas, sweet onion, Thai chili, garlic and sweet Thai Basil - Delicious!

To be fair, Thai is not one of my favorites, but we love to support local restaurants and this came highly recommended. Glad we tried it. 

And for those of you who like it HOT and SPICY - Wild Thaiger has you covered."
The product did not last for more than 2months. Battery got drained up and phone refused to start. Even after repairing it did not improve. We are thinking of getting it replaced as its still under warranty period.

"RT @MartinOMalley: Didn’t see the #GOPdebate, but heard it was entertaining. #WWOMD? Have more democratic debates. -O'M #WeNeedDebate"
Just like  my other Samsung phone experience... This one is also like those . Phone hangs always... You can't even play PUBG mobile .. Not recommended.
"It sucks , useless phone"
What I learned from last nights  #GOPDebate is if @realDonaldTrump becomes president I will be the first one to move out of the country!

"Battery also draining fast without internet use, aslo heating too when use camera ,  want to replace handset"
"Everything on the phone whether it is FP reader, battery, display, charging and bundled 18 watts fast charger with it and it's extremely competitive 12000 rupees price for 6/64 gb variant all features are top notch on the phone."
I will disappoint this m20phone..very poor quality phone
All get at budget price.. nice user interface
RT @GlitchxCity: Donald Trump is only a publicity stunt and a phase right? Right? #GOPDebate
Mind Blowing Phone by Oppo
mobile home screen gets hang. unable to move mobile home screen. Don't buy this mobile. Go for other option
"PROS
 Camera takes excellent photos in the 48MP resolution. Dynamic colour gradients add to the flair. Performance sets a new benchmark in the mid-range segment.
CONS
Bright LCD panel, but can't match up to the AMOLED display on the Samsung Galaxy M30 Shooting at 48MP is pointless since you won't get the required sharpness and details for large prints

Verdict
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 is a good option to buy in the mid-range budget. The configuration of the smartphone quite good to perform well. The smartphone comes with a huge storage space for storing large amount of data or files. The camera quality of the smartphone is very good for clicking good images and videos."
Average camera! Good Processor. Overall decent phone for price you pay

Finger print is not working properly camera quality is not good  but battery life is very good. If you wanna buy for battery than it is good but for other features like camra processors is not good.
I ve searched a lot and believe me it's a good phone in this range...Amazon service is simply awesome...in the night I ordered the phone and next morning it was delivered...every feature is working great and no complaints.....
"hello

Worst vivo phone ever made

"I have a love/hate relationship with Costco. I love to support local businesses, but this is one of a couple of exceptions I make.  It seems they treat their employees fairly as most of the employees at this store seem to have been there for years if not a decade. One thing that gives me comfort in my purchasing is they have a terrific return policy and take about anything back."
Screen is very dull
I purchased new one plus 7T on 16th and started yesterday but now my WhatsApp is not working at all.It seems this piece is second copy plz help
good battery life with average camera mibile leging problem start with day 1
Very impressed touch and good camera and long time battery back up
Initially battery charging was taking less time but now with use of phone its speed of charging has come down..I m not happy with kind of camera Samsung is providing if we compare with vivo and other phones.
Camera is not up to the mark. But battery is fantastic.
This is the worst phone i have seen from MI brand can't use apps properly its hangs like anything. very disappointed
Mobile temperature is increasing while calls or browsing internet.
Best in natural camera
I like the huge battery provided for m20 and also the performance of the processor and also the screen clarity and size and the v notch.I think there should be improvement in camera especially the front camera.
"I have purchased this mobile in october 2019,then camera was good, after 3 months of usage, Camera with flash is not working good and panorama and few photo options are completely blurred..it was the worst exeprience im having with the camera.Battery life is good."
dont wanna work tonight
Good
"Battery life is very poor.
Finger print sensor faulty within 15days"
"This phone is no doubt one of the best for the price. The camera at this price point is tremendous and get a lot of the job done, with a few tweaks you can get the Gcam API which improves the performance drastically, the screen is also nice has a good color gamut and also the fingerprint reader is pretty quick.

The only downside I think would be the battery life because a single charge would last you only for half of the day doing heavy work on the phone other than that it pretty good."
"🎖️Fully satisfied with phone.
🎖️Camera is good
🎖️No excessive heating problem in gaming
🎖️No excessive heating in charging
🎖️Plus point in camera is macro camera
🎖️Good in size as mobile phone are getting bigger in size which makes them nearly impossible to use with one hand, but some how I manage to use it with a single ✋ hand without enough difficulty.
🎖️ For me it's the best phone available in the range of 10k
🎖️ Premium looks with back glass pannel and silver side body made with plastic but looks steel.

🛑 Face look ID is provided but it's useless unlocks the phone even on closed eyes and even if make wierd faces it unlocks it.🤔 But finger print serves the purpose.
🛑 Cameras are poped out to far back cover provided with covers it but if you use any other back cover couldn't cover it properly. So you have be careful with it to avoid scratches at Cameras glass.

✔️ Go for it without any doubt if you want a budget phone for normal use. Bought it in November 2019 reviewing in March 2020, I am using 4+64 version and feels like getting more than enough in 10k. 👍"
Don't buy this phone at all looks premium but at 13k very low quality. Camera issues came and didnt give options replace after 10 days at mi store. Mi should really put they didnt give warranty.

"Bought it a bit higher cost 10K could be 8K max.
Overall Ok product and can be used in daily use with normal usage but for not heavy use."
"Display: Excellent
Battery: Excellent
Camera: Average
Overall experience: Very Good
OS: Android 10
Product was shipped on time.
Packaging was good.
My only complaint with this phone is the camera quality. I wish the camera was better."
"-Samsung Android
-camera not special, bad at less light and not fast
-battery at first three days perfect, then seems like less for this big battery
-no sensor for display brightness. It use the build in camera, but this  needs more battery
-no light for notification
-no cover or screen protector delievered
+display is good
+weight is good
+price is good

Maybe you are more happier with the Redmi Note 8.

Good
Not good but not bad also
Its only 7 month now my phone has become a hanging garden.
"AMAZING. Everything we had was the best we have eaten; sushi, crab cakes, oysters!  It's a MUST if near the Scottsdale Quarter!  We chose to eat there 2 nights in a row, once for a reserved dinner and the other for the happy hour."
"Great experience and sharing my review after using for 10 days. Got delivered within 10 hours, awesome battery life with 6000 mah power. Uploading few pic taken in Gokarna."
"Excellent 📷 images with 64MP camera 👌
Battery charge lasts easily for full day right now ✌ The mobile is outstanding in this price range and worth every penny. 👍
Coming to No cost EMI, interest is being charged on EMIs other than GST, Which takes away the offered price of 17999 - 10%discount on credit card - No cost EMI discount, which was very attractive at the time of buying"
"Build quality is poor,
Finger biometric scaner takes time to unlock
Face scanner doesn't work some time.

The only thing I like is battery backup is better because of 5000mah."
Very good  battery performance
